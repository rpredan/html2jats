			<h1 class="abs">Abstract</h1>
			<p class="abs">There are many options for reconstruction of defects after head and neck oncological surgery. Among them, the free fasciocutaneous radial flap, the free anterolateral thigh flap and the pedicled myocutaneous pectoralis major flap are the most commonly implemented ones.</p>
			<p class="abs">The fasciocutaneous supraclavicular artery island flap (SCAIF) is a versatile flap harvested from the supraclavicular and shoulder area. It is based on the supraclavicular artery branching off the transverse cervical artery. The origin of the supraclavicular artery is located within the triangle bounded by the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the clavicle and the external jugular vein. Due to its length of 26 cm, the width of 6–7 cm and the arc of rotation, the SCAIF is suitable for reconstruction of various defects of the head and neck, such as lateral defects of the skin, the parotid and in exceptional cases temporal region. On the other hand, it is also appropriate for reconstructing the mucosal defects of the oral cavity, pharynx and oesophagus, and also for postoperative fistula treatment.</p>
			<p class="abs">We describe a case of locally advanced carcinoma of the external auricular canal and a case of an extensive metastasis in the parotid gland in which we used the SCAIF for reconstruction.</p>
			<p class="abs">The SCAIF harvesting is surgically straightforward and fast. The SCAIF is reliable, and safe, has few complications, and yields a good functional and cosmetic outcome. It is widely useful for reconstructing various soft tissue defects of the head and neck.</p>

			<h1><span>1 </span>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The consequences of resection of advanced cancer of the head and the neck are defects that often require reconstruction. Defects are divided into bony and soft-tissue. The latter are superficial because of the loss of skin or mucous membrane and deep because of loss of soft tissue beneath the surface&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>.</p>
			<p>The advantages of the pedicled myocutaneous pectoralis major flap (PM), such as simple and fast harvesting of the flap, satisfactory length of the vascular pedicle, a high level of reliability, and good functional and aesthetic results, are the reason that PM is considered a good solution in the reconstruction of the head and the neck defects&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. Among pedicled flaps used for reconstruction of head and neck, the fasciocutaneous deltopectoral flap (DP) is somewhat less used today, but was the most common reconstruction option before the introduction of PM. It can be used for more than just covering extensive skin defects on the neck and face, as in combination with other flaps it provides skin for the reconstruction of the superficial part of the defect&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. An alternative for small to medium sized (superficial and deep) defects in the middle of the neck is the small deltopectoral flap (SDP). Our first experience with SDP were described by Aničin, who used it for closing a tracheocutaneous and laryngocutaneous fistula, for covering a skin defect after the removal of an extensive metastasis in the pretracheal (Delphian) lymph node, and for the reconstruction of the defect caused by the removal of laryngeal cancer with laryngectomy&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>.</p>
			<p>The introduction of PM (in 1979) almost coincided with the introduction of microvascular surgery (in 1981), opening new options for reconstruction, while also lowering the frequency of use and interest in pedicled flaps. We could say that it consigned PM to relative obscurity&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. Numerous surgeons use the radial free fasciocutaneous flap (RFFF) and the free perforator anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) as the first options for reconstruction&#160;<span class="xref">(5,6)</span>.</p>
			<p>In spite of diverse indications the above flaps have a few shortcomings. The dimensions of the major pectoral muscle make PM bulky, which can hamper the primary skin closure, and its large mass can lead to an opening in the healing surgical wound&#160;<span class="xref">(7)</span>. This can only occur when the pedicle is insufficiently narrowed at the clavicle, when the flap is placed in a sub-optimal position and is not sufficiently attached to the surrounding tissues with surgical sutures.</p>
			<p>DP is less convenient because of the need for a second stage division of the pedicle. It is also aesthetically less acceptable, as the donor site has to be closed with a split thickness skin graft&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. In this perspective SDP has the advantage, as the primary closure of the donor site gap can be completed without any issues. Unlike with DP, both ablation and reconstruction can be conducted during the same procedure. However, because of the dimensions, a small rotation angle and a shorter reach SDP, is only suitable for selected defects low in the medium part of the neck&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>.</p>
			<p>Special surgical knowledge is required for microvascular flaps, and depending on the expertise of an individual centre/department perhaps even an additional surgical team is required, as well as a lot of time, and detailed monitoring of the flap’s vitality, and increased therapy costs. Because of the distance, the colour and structure of the donor site do not match the skin of the head and the neck&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>. It is also possible that the donor site heals poorly. These flaps are less suitable for older polimorbid patients&#160;<span class="xref">(9)</span>. Because of the postirradiational changes of the vessels, microvascular flaps have a higher incidence of thrombosis than pedicled flaps, and are consequently, for the so-called salvage operations a worse choice than the pedicled flaps&#160;<span class="xref">(10-12)</span>. Besides this, RFFF also leaves an aesthetically unsatisfactory scar on the forearm.</p>
			<p>Because of the limitations of microvascular flaps and the growing number of patients undergoing radiation therapy, pedicled flaps are again rising in popularity. Some of them were presented by Paučič&#160;<span class="xref">(9)</span>. The supraclavicular artery island flap (SCAIF) is a fasciocutaneous flap from the area above the clavicle and the shoulder. With regard to size, thickness and volume it is similar to RFFF, and with obese patients it becomes thicker because of the increased subdermal fat, making it more similar to ALT&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>. The advantage of SCAIF is that it does not have any of the limitations of PM, DP, SDP RFFF and ALT, and that its harvesting is surgically simple and fast.</p>
			<h1><span>2 </span>The history of the supraclavicular flap</h1>
			<p>Shoulder has taken the interest of surgeons as a possible donor site fairly soon, as Mütter describes a medial-based random flap of the shoulder already in 1842&#160;<span class="xref">(14)</span>. SCAIF was described by Lamberty in 1979&#160;<span class="xref">(15)</span>, and was made popular by Pallua in 1997&#160;<span class="xref">(16)</span>.</p>
			<p>In comparison with PM, FRRR and ALT, which are most often used for reconstructing soft-tissue defects on the head and the neck, SCAIF is less well known. There are only 40 articles that include the term “Supraclavicular Artery Island Flap” in their title on the PubMed portal as of today. In Slovenia it is also rarely used. At the Ljubljana University Medical Centre’s Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervicofacial Surgery we began using it in 2018, and have used it twice so far.</p>
			<h1><span>3 </span>Surgical technique</h1>
			<p>As the name implies, SCAIF is supplied by the supraclavicular artery, which is a branch of the transverse cervical artery, with accompanying veins. The artery branching is the axis of flap’s rotation and the point where the supraclavicular artery enters into the flap from inside the neck. During flap harvesting this artery is exposed and can be vulnerable. The branching is located in the imaginary triangle on the neck with the sides set with a posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), the external jugular vein (EJV) and the clavicle – <span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span> and <span class="ref-fig">Figure 2</span>.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The flap is planned laterally from the branching of the supraclaviacular artery towards the shoulder. Its length is 26 cm, and at the broadest part it reaches 6–7 cm. Distally the flap runs a few centimetres over above the deltoid muscle. The gap of the donor site of this size can be closed primarily&#160;<span class="xref">(17,18)</span>.</p>
			<p>The incision of the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia begins laterally from the triangle in the angle between the clavicle and the EJV. It follows the scope of the planned flap and concludes in the angle between EJV and SCM. The flap is harvested from distal towards proximal in the subfascial plane, i.e. just above the deltoid muscle, the pectoralis major muscle, the trapezius muscle and the clavicle.</p>
			<p>When harvesting the flap the vascular pedicle must be retained. It is not exposed during the surgery, but fascia and the fat around it are kept intact to prevent the kinking of the vessels, as this could endanger the flap’s vitality. The flow of the supraclavicular artery can be identified using a Doppler ultrasound examination or a computed tomography angiography, even though this is not strictly necessary&#160;<span class="xref">(17)</span>. The next step is a rotation of the prepared flap and suturing it into the defect. With transposition of the flap under unaffected skin to the neck (i.e. tunnelling) a de-epithelialization of the skin of the proximal part of the flap is needed&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>.</p>
			<p>Skin at the SCAIF donor site must first be “mobilized” in the subcutaneous fat plane so that the donor site can be closed primarily. During the neck dissection of the level IV or V the position of the transverse cervical artery is taken into account, as it supplies blood to the supraclavicular artery, which is why it is essential to protect it&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>4 </span>The first case</h1>
			<p>A 76-year-old female was treated for carcinoma of the left external auditory canal with paralysis of the facial nerve. The tumour blocked the entrance to the external auditory canal and was spreading across the tragus to the skin anteriorly of the auricle into the posterior part of the left parotid gland, the earlobe and the medial surface of the auricle (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 3</span>). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the tumour was infiltrating the superficial and the deep lobe of the parotid gland, the tympanic cavity and the mastoid cells. The tumour was spreading around the anterior and lateral surface of the articular process of the mandible, growing into the temporomandibular joint, and through the articular surface it was minimally protruding intracranially into the middle cranial fossa and towards the temporal brain lobe. There were several cervical lymph nodes of up to 1 cm in size on the neck.</p>

					<p class="caption"><bold class="blue">Figure 3:</bold> Cancer of the left external auricular canal, auricle and preauricular region.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>We conducted a neck dissection (removing levels II, III, IV and the internal jugular vein), amputation of the ear, total parotidectomy and resection of the facial nerve. We resected a part of the masseter muscle, a posterior part of the ramus of the mandible with an articular process, a part of the pterygoid muscles, zygomatic arch and the temporal muscle. We also conducted a subtotal petrosectomy. Because of the spread of the malignoma into the sigmoid sinus and along the whole dura mater of the medium fossa, radical resection was not possible. The gap remaining after the ablative part of the operation is shown in <span class="ref-fig">Figure 4</span>.</p>
			<p>We harvested the SCAIF, made a “tunnel” between the platysma and the SCM (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 5</span>), proximally deepithalized the flap, moved it through the tunnel to the neck, and placed it over the defect (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 6</span>).</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The final histologic results of the primary tumour revealed that it was a grade II invasive squamous-cell carcinoma with a peri- and intraneural invasion and lymphatic invasion. There were a total of 48 isolated lymph nodes, of which 13 were infiltrated with the metastatic cancer, and in three of them extracapsullar spread was proven. After the operation the patient received radiation therapy.</p>
			<h1><span>5 </span>The second case</h1>
			<p>A 65-year-old male with dementia, who had an operation for squamous-cell carcinoma of the left conjunctiva a year prior, was admitted because of a poorly mobile swelling, 5 cm in diameter, in the area of the left parotid gland. A slimy liquid oozed from the swelling. Cytological examination confirmed metastasis of the squamous cell cancer. Skin was also infiltrated by the metastasis, while the function of the facial nerve was preserved.</p>
			<p>Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI showed a tumour with a diameter of 37 mm. It was growing into the subcutaneous tissue of the cheek, the masseter muscle and the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. There were no additional metastases on the neck.</p>
			<p>A selective supraomohyoid neck dissection and an extended partial parotidectomy (removal of the segments I, II, IV of the parotid gland)&#160;<span class="xref">(19)</span>. Because of the infiltration by the metastasis we performed a resection of the zygomatic and temporal branch of the facial nerve. We removed the nearest part of the masseter muscle and excised the periosteum from the zygomatic process, as the metastasis was attached to it.</p>
			<p>We harvested the SCAIF, formed a tunnel and deepitalized the proximal part of the flap. Then we turned it through the tunnel to the neck and covered the defect. After extensive mobilization of the skin from the edge of the donor site, we primarily closed it under tension.</p>
			<p>The following day the radial nerve became paralysed, manifested as a complete inability to extend the fingers and the wrist. Because the excessive tension of the closure at the donor site could have been the reason for this, we removed the stitches, opened the wound and released the tension. In the following days we noted a gradual clinical improvement of the paralysis, which completely dissapeared in two weeks. The defect at the donor site was later covered with a split thickness skin graft.</p>
			<p>The final histological results showed 28 reactive lymph nodes without metastases. Tumour process was defined as grade II invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. According to the pathologist’s report the intraparotid lymph node was completely overgrown by metastasis with an extensive extracapsular extension. Because malignant cells were present in the resection margin at the bottom of the resection, the operation was not radical. We prescribed adjuvant radiation therapy, which was then stopped, because of lack of compliance of the patient.</p>
			<p>Two months after surgery an abscess formed in the area below SCAIF. After imaging was conducted we performed a surgical drainage to remove the pus and found slimy soft tissue, characteristic of cancer progression. Later histological examination confirmed this. We recommended palliative therapy for the patient. <span class="ref-fig">Figure 7</span> shows the condition 1 month after surgery. <span class="ref-fig">Figure 8</span> shows the condition 1 week after the revision because of the abscess and the progression of the disease from below the flap.</p>

			<h1><span>6 </span>Discussion and review of the literature</h1>
			<p>The rise in popularity of the microvascular surgery in the past decades brought new reconstruction options for the area of the head and the neck. The advantages are good aesthetic and functional results. For superficial defects smaller RFFFs are most often utilized, while for defects that reach from the surface into the depth, the thicker ALT is used.</p>
			<p>Locally and regionally advanced cancer of larynx and hypopharynx demand a laryngectomy. In the past few years we have been treating an increasing number of such patients with radiation therapy and chemotherapy that permit the preservation of the larynx. Consequently, there is a growing number of cancer patients who have already received radiation therapy and require treatment because of a progression or recurrence or a new primary tumour. For such patients surgery is the only remaining option of curative therapy. The downside of previous therapy (radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy) is a significantly increased risk for thrombosis of the anastomosis of the free flap. This results in an interrupted blood supply and necrosis of the free flap. In consquence, patients who had already received radiation therapy are less suitable for microvascular reconstruction, with pedicled local and regional flaps as the safer choice&#160;<span class="xref">(10-12)</span>.</p>
			<p>Superficial bulky defects which would have been reconstructed using ALT during primary surgery, are reconstructed using PM on patients who had received radiation therapy. With only superficial defects on the skin or the mucous membrane, where tissue does not need to be replaced in the depth, and the PM would be too thick, we use SCAIF instead of RFFF. It has similar thickness as RFFF, and none of its limitations.</p>
			<h2><span>6.1 </span>Indications</h2>
			<p>At the branching of the supraclavicular artery (the axis of rotation) SCAIF is rotated by 180⁰. Because of this rotation’s geometry, SCAIF is especially suitable for covering skin defects on the lateral side of the neck and the parotid area, which we demonstrated in our cases. Kokot finds the same, as he reports on using SCAIF to cover skin defects on the neck, face, after parotidectomy, after ear amputation and resection of the temporal bone&#160;<span class="xref">(18)</span>.</p>
			<p>On the other hand SCAIF is also useful for covering the defects of the mucosa of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>, to cover fistulas after surgery&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>, and after the surgery of stomal recurrences&#160;<span class="xref">(17)</span>. Also described are reconstructions of very complex defects, such as transmural gap after the surgery of a buccal carcinoma&#160;<span class="xref">(20)</span>, where SCAIF is folded and reconstructs both the mucous membrane and the skin side of a defect on a cheek, and the reconstruction of a circumferential defect of pharynx after laryngectomy and total pharyngectomy&#160;<span class="xref">(21)</span>.</p>
			<p>Because of its simplicity and reliability some authors put is as first choice among all fasciocuteous flaps for the reconstruction of the defects on the head and the neck&#160;<span class="xref">(22)</span>.</p>
			<h2><span>6.2 </span>Duration of surgery</h2>
			<p>Because it is not necessary to identify the vessel pedicle to harvest SCAIF, flap harvesting does not take a lot of time. Kokot required on average 34.9 minutes for harvesting, and an additional 15.2 minutes for deepitalization&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>. In a later study he reports on even shorter time, namely 30.5 and 13.6 minutes&#160;<span class="xref">(18)</span>. Van Weert reports that less than 50 minutes are needed for harvesting SCAIF&#160;<span class="xref">(17)</span>. Lee states that an experienced surgeon requires less than 15 minutes&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>.</p>
			<p>In our cases we harvested SCAIF in 48 and 42 minutes, and did not measure the time required for deepitalization and tunnelling. We believe that as we gain experience, harvesting time will decline for upcoming patients.</p>
			<h2><span>6.3 </span>Dissection of the neck</h2>
			<p>With both patients we conducted a selective dissection of the neck on the same side. In the first case the regions II, III and IV were removed. Because the undamaged transverse cervical artery is a precondition for performing SCAIF, the dissection of region IV required a specially meticulous and careful preparation. With the second patient the dissection included regions I, II and III, so transverse cervical artery was never in direct danger.</p>
			<p>Among the 45 and 22 patients on whom Kokot performed SCAIF, he also performed a selective dissection of the neck that included regions IV or V in 64% or 40.9% cases&#160;<span class="xref">(13,14)</span>. The results of the analysis showed that the level of the dissection of the neck does not affect the incidence of SCAIF necrosis.</p>
			<h2><span>6.4 </span>Complications</h2>
			<p>Necrosis of the flap is not good news. For a patient it means at least extended hospitalization, if not even another operation. Fortunately this is rare for SCAIF. Kokot reported on 9.1–18% partial and 4–4.5% full flap necrosis. They required another reconstruction with PM&#160;<span class="xref">(13,18)</span>. Fang did not notice any necrosis in his study&#160;<span class="xref">(20)</span>. In our cases there was also no necrosis.</p>
			<h2><span>6.5 </span>Complications at the donor site</h2>
			<p>If the flap width is 7 cm or less, a primary closure of the donor site is possible&#160;<span class="xref">(13,23)</span>. Authors describe an opening of a healing wound (dehiscence) at the donor site in 5–13.6% of the cases&#160;<span class="xref">(13,18,20,21)</span>.</p>
			<p>In the second patient a radial nerve paralysis occured in a postoperative period which has not been described in literature. Paralysis most likely occurred because of excessive tension at the primary closure of the donor site. Primary closure was difficult, as it was not possible to approximate the edges. Only after extensive skin mobilisation (i.e. so-called undermining) did the primary closure succeed. We believe that the consequent tension was the reason for the compartment syndrome. Vitality of the upper limb was not threatened, as the capillary return on the fingers and the artery pulses on the wrist were present. After removing the cause (cutting the sutures, releasing the tension), paralysis gradually went away.</p>
			<p>We are not aware of the causes for the issues with closing the wound at the donor site. When harvesting the flap we adhered to the recommended dimensions that still allow a primary closure. These are 26 cm in length and 6–7 cm in width&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>. The flap width for our patient was 7 cm. There have been reports of flap widths of 8 cm and even up to 10 cm, with a primary closure still possible, however, it all depends on the skin flexibility&#160;<span class="xref">(8,22)</span>.</p>
			<p>In our case we once again learned that wounds should not be closed primarily at all cost. And especially not at the expense of increased tension. In such circumstances it is safer to cover with a skin graft. Di Benedetto closed 3.6% of his donor sites after SCAIF this way&#160;<span class="xref">(24)</span>. When expecting issues with a primary closure, a preliminary implantation of a tissue expander under the flap is also an option. After this a flap with dimensions of up to 30 cm × 14 cm can be harvested, used to close larger defects, and the primary closure is also easier&#160;<span class="xref">(25)</span>.</p>
			<h2><span>6.6 </span>Shoulder mobility</h2>
			<p>Using SCAIF does not require a dissection of the motor nerves, nor does it include the muscles of the shoulder girdle into the flap. Consequently, functional impact of the shoulder resulting from harvesting SCAIF is not expected.</p>
			<p>Herr reports that in most of the 10 patients that received SCAIF reconstruction, he noted normal mobility of the shoulder joint&#160;<span class="xref">(26)</span>. Spiegel did also not notice in any of the 20 patients in the group any significant differences between the side that was operated on and the other one in relation to mobility, pain and the patients’ daily activities&#160;<span class="xref">(23)</span>. We also did not notice any issues with pain or mobility of the shoulder with our patients.</p>
			<h1><span>7 </span>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In the past few decades there have been tremendous advances in reconstruction of tissue defects after surgical therapy of cancer of the head and neck, especially because of microvascular surgery. However, not every patient is suitable for such procedures, and not every defect requires a reconstruction with a free microvascular flap.</p>
			<p>SCAIF is one of the pedicled flaps that can be used instead of the more popular PM, DP, RFFF and ALT. Some of its characteristics surpass the limitations of the above flaps. Unlike PM, SCAIF allows for reconstruction without any issues related to excessive thickness of the flap, which can lead in some cases of reconstruction with PM into issues with closing the wound and dehiscence. Ablative and reconstruction part of the operation with SCAIF is conducted during the same procedure, and the gap of the donor site is closed primarily, which places it above DP. A simple and fast surgical harvesting without any microvascular anastomoses are just a few features of SCAIF that make it suitable for use on polimorbid patients who received radiation therapy in whom microvascular flaps are not a good reconstruction option.</p>
			<p>In spite of early experience with SCAIF we successfully used the flap in two cases. According to the literature SCAIF is a safe, reliable, simple and broadly useful fasciocutaneous flap that can be used for closing defects of skin and mucous membrane, both after primary and salvage surgical therapy.</p>
