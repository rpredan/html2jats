            <title>Abstract</title>
            <p>Background: Almost 50 % of patients in clinical practice still have poor control of their asthma despite treatment according to the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) criteria. The most common causes of uncontrolled asthma are: poor inhaler technique, poor medication adherence, incorrect diagnosis, comorbidities (rhinosinusitis, GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), obesity, depression, obstructive sleep apnea) and ongoing exposure to specific triggers (allergens, drugs and smoking).</p>
            <p>Methods: Observational study was conducted on 323 adult patients with uncontrolled asthma in 14 outpatient pulmonology practices in Slovenia in the period from December 2017 to April 2018. Data about common causes of uncontrolled asthma and exacerbations in the last year were entered in electronic case report forms at the investigator’s site.</p>
            <p>Results: The most common factors associated with uncontrolled asthma were comorbidities in 70 % (obesity 33 %, rhinosinusitis 28 %, GERD 22 %), specific triggers in 56 % (ongoing exposure to allergens 39 %, drugs 35 %, smoking 10 %) and poor medication adherence in 53 %. Thirty percent of patients had one or more severe exacerbations in the last year. Patient’s non-understanding of the role of asthma medications (95 % IZ: [1.4; 4.8]; p = 0.019) and the lack of self-management plan (95 % IZ: [1.3; 4.3]; p = 0.042) were the most important factors in the logistic regression model for severe exacerbations. 23 % of included patients had severe asthma according to the GINA criteria.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: Obesity, specific triggers and poor medication adherence are the most important factors for uncontrolled asthma in the adult patient sample with uncontrolled asthma in pneumology outpatient clinics in Slovenia. Severe exacerbations are still present in these patients. Therefore, better education and providing all asthma patients with written self-management plan would be warranted in the future.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Asthma is a common chronic disease of the respiratory tract. The objective of treating asthma according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines is to achieve asthma control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Asthma control includes controlling the symptoms and lowering the risk for: acute asthmatic exacerbation, development of a permanent obstruction in the respiratory tract, and the onset of local and systemic effects of medications. The assessment of symptom control is based on the checking four clinical parameters during the last four weeks before a patient’s assessment. With regard to the presence of daily and nightly symptoms, the use of the controller and the patient’s limited activity, asthma can be defined as either controlled, partially controlled or uncontrolled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

         <p>The international study REALISE (The REcognise Asthma and LInk to Symptoms and Experience), which included 8000 asthma patients aged between 18 to 50, showed that in spite of therapy, 45% of patients have uncontrolled asthma. The data on patients was obtained through email surveys in 11 European countries. The level of asthma control was assessed according to GINA criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The study conducted in Slovenia showed that with 38% of asthma patients the disease is uncontrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p>
         <p>The most frequent causes for uncontrolled asthma are: irregular medication adherence, poor patient cooperation, incorrect asthma diagnosis, comorbidities that cause complications, such as rhinosinusitis, GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), anxiety and depression, obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea, smoking, and ongoing exposure to specific triggers (beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or exposure to allergens in the work or home environment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Treatment-resistant severe asthma resulting from uncontrolled asthma occurs in a small share of patients. The Dutch monitoring study discovered that severe asthma – according to the measures of the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) – is only present in 4.5% of asthma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In the past few years we developed new biological drugs that decrease the number of moderate and severe exacerbations for some of the patients with severe asthma, and lower the need for treatment with systemic glucocorticoids.  The phenotypic definition of asthma plays a key role in the selection of a biological drug. Anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies (omalizumab) are used for treating severe allergy asthma, while anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab) and IL-5R (benralizumab) are used for treating non-allergic eosinophilic asthma. At the moment no other effective biological drugs for other phenotypes of severe asthma are yet in clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p>
         <p>In the article we present the results of the study of adult patients with uncontrolled asthma, who were treated in a 5-month period in 2017 and 2018 in outpatient specialist clinics in Slovenia.</p>
         <p>The goal of our study was to find the most frequent causes for uncontrolled asthma on a sample of adult asthma patients in Slovenia. The article also focuses on the frequency of severe asthma exacerbations in the past year, the connection between the causes for uncontrolled asthma and an increasing number of severe exacerbation and the estimation of the share of patients with severe asthma.</p>

            <p>In this non-interventional observational cross-section study pulmonology and internal medicine specialists included adult patients with uncontrolled asthma, who were treated between December 2017 and April 2018 in one of 14 outpatient specialist clinics in Slovenia. The treated patients came in for their regular check-up at the specialist clinic, or were referred there by their family doctors because of uncontrolled asthma. Only patients over 18 years of age with a clinical asthma diagnosis confirmed more than 12 months prior to the study through a positive bronchodilator test or a positive methacholine challenge test (PD20 with 2 mg methacholine or less) were accepted for participation. Asthma had to be uncontrolled according to GINA criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). If the patients had an exacerbation of their asthma that required a change of the sustained treatment one month before the start of the study, they were not included for participation. Other exclusionary measures included acute disease, pregnancy and participation in any clinical trials in the past 12 months.</p>

            <p>The data was collected from the patients’ medical records, based on the information the physician obtained from the subjects during the check-up, and based on the specialist’s professional assessment. The data was entered in an electronic system for data collection. In the first part of the electronic questionnaire the physicians entered the demographic data, when the asthma diagnosis was first made, the currently prescribed asthma medication, and pulmonary function tests conducted on the date of visit. The obstruction was defined as a decrease of the Tiffeneau index (T.I.) – the ratio between the forced exhaled volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the vital capacity (VC) – (FEV<sub>1</sub>/VC) by more than 12% below the reference value. All patients with a respiratory obstruction were also given a bronchodilator test. The test was deemed positive, if, after 15 minutes and 4 inhalations of (0.4 mg) salbumatol, the FEV<sub>1</sub> value increased by 12% of the exit value, and by at least 200 ml. In the second part the possible reasons for uncontrolled asthma were entered. The specialist conducted a direct control check of the use of the inhaler and assessed whether it was proper, acceptable or poor. Physicians rated inhaler use as proper when the patient used it completely correctly, as acceptable when they made one or several mistakes that did not significantly impact the administered dosage of the medication, and as poor when the patient made a critical error that resulted in them receiving no or just a small dose of medication. Adherence was estimated based on the difference between medications issued and medications used, as taken from the electronic prescription database. Adherent patients were those whose asthma medications were regularly prescribed, and they picked them up at the pharmacy on time. Based on a specialist’s professional judgment we assessed the patient’s understanding of asthma medication, the unsuitability of prescribed medication and any potential presence of specific asthma triggers in the patient’s environment. We obtained the data on comorbidities and conditions, and the asthma self-management plan they were issued from their medical documentation and anamnesis. The physicians also entered the number of severe exacerbations in the past year and their professional judgement about whether the patient is suffering from severe asthma. Severe exacerbations were defined in the study as asthma exacerbation in which the patient required help from the medical staff at a clinic or the emergency room, and had a breathing frequency above 30/min, a heart rate above 120 bpm, oxygen saturation below 90%, and a PEF rate below 50% of the top value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). GINA international guidelines define severe asthma as asthma that has in the past 12 months required treatment with high dosages of inhaled glucocorticoids (IGK) along with one more blocking drug and/or system glucocorticoid (for at least 6 months) for achieving asthma control, or, when asthma remains uncontrolled, even after such therapy. A high dosage of inhaled glucocorticoid is when the daily dosage of the medication surpasses 800 µg for Budesonide, 500 µg for Fluticasone, 320 µg for Ciclesonide, 800 µg for Mometasone and 400 µg for Beclomethasone (HFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p>

            <p>All variables were summed up using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were displayed using a median and standard deviation; dispersions were also presented graphically. Categorical variables were displayed with the number and the shares (percentages). Except for the presentation of descriptive statistics there were no <italic>a priori</italic> statistical analyses planned. Logistic regression was used <italic>post hoc</italic> for exploratory analysis of possible correlation of select variables with the onset of severe exacerbation. The base model included the following variables: self-management plans, understanding the role of medication, regular medication application, correct inhalation technique, correctly prescribed therapy, comorbidities, and specific triggers. The results with the value of p &lt; 0.05 were marked as statistically significant. Data processing and analyses were performed using the R software environment, version 3.3.1.</p>

         <p>The analysed sample included 323 asthma patients who visited pneumatology clinics between 27 December 2017 and 30 April 2018. Of these, 114 (35.3%) patients were men, and 209 (64.7%) were women. The median age of all the patients was 56.8 years. Before joining the study, the patients had asthma for an average of 13.4 years. 48 of the participants were smokers, while 275 of them were non-smokers or former smokers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). 222 patients (68.7%) had normal pulmonary functions, while with 101 patients (31.3%) an obstruction on the respiratory tract was measured with a spirometer, so another spirometry was conducted after a bronchodilator test. After the bronchodilator test the pulmonary function was normalized for 19 patients (5.8%). With 82 patients (25.3%) the obstruction was partially reversible (a positive bronchodilator test) or irreversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Of the medications, 300 patients (92.9%) used controllers, while 23 patients (7.1%) were without one. 19 patients (5.9%) did not use any other therapy except for a controller. 84 patients (26.0%) used single-tier therapy, 152 (47.1%) used 2-tier therapy, 49 (15.2%) used 3-tier therapy, 17 (5.3%) used 4-tier therapy, while 2 patients (0.6%) used 5-tier therapy. None of them used biological medications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p>
         <p>207 patients (64.1%) had a self-treatment plan, while 208 (64.4%) understood the function of controller and preventer medication, 172 (53.3%) took their medications regularly, 117 (36.2%) occasionally, and 34 patients (10.4%) did not take medications at all. 160 patients (49.5%) demonstrated a proper technique of using the inhaler, 109 patients (33.7%) demonstrated an acceptable technique, and 54 patients (16.7%) a poor one. According to the specialist 240 patients (74.3%) had an appropriate therapy prescribed, while 83 patients (25.7%) did not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p>
         <p>Comorbidities that could significantly affect how controlled asthma is, were present with 227 patients (70.3%), while 96 patients (29.7%) did not have any such diseases. Among comorbidities, obesity was prevalent with 108 patients (33.4%), chronic rhinosinusitis with 93 patients (28.8%), and GERD with 72 patients (22.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). 114 patients (36.8%) had two or more comorbidities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

         <p>180 patients (55.7%) had specific triggers for uncontrolled asthma present, while 143 patients (44.3%) were not exposed to such triggers. 98 patients were exposed to allergens (54.4% of all exposed), 81 patients were exposed to medication (45.0% of all exposed) and 29 patients were exposed to smoking in their environment (16.1% of all exposed). Of the patients exposed to specific triggers, 152 (84.4% of all exposed) had 1 specific trigger present, and 28 (15.6% of all exposed) had 2 specific triggers present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). Among medications that could affect uncontrolled asthma, ACE inhibitors (44.2%) and beta-receptor blockers (24.7%) were the most prevalent.</p>

         <p>Asthma is treated by levels in 5 steps with regard to the current state of asthma control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The level of asthma control is defined by clinical symptoms, while the severity of the disease is rated by the medications required for maintaining control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The Gaining Optimal Asthma ControL (GOAL) study showed that levelled treatment and good patient adherence can achieve a good control of asthma with most patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, while observational studies have adversely shown that a large share of patients still have uncontrolled asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Uncontrolled asthma is linked to a large number of severe exacerbations, an accelerated decline of pulmonary function, a decreased quality of life, it lowers the patient’s productivity and increases the costs of treating the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p>

         <p>Our study included adult patients of all ages, who had been in treatment for asthma for at least one year. 68.7% of all the participating patients with uncontrolled asthma still had a normal pulmonary function, which is a good indication for future course of the disease. With others we discovered an obstructive ventilation disorder through spirometry, and for 5.8% of patients it was completely resolved after inhaling bronchodilator. The group of patients with such an obstruction in the respiratory tract shows the need for scaling up the levelled asthma treatment to the next phase. With 24.3% patients the obstruction on the respiratory tract was partially reversible (a positive bronchodilator test) or irreversible. Some of the patients from this group have severe asthma and an inflammatory airway, which may result in a permanent obstruction. Others are patients who may not have received sufficient doses of controlling medications, either because the prescribed dosage of controlling medication was too low, or because of a poor technique of using the inhaler or adherence.  Regular and correct treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids (IGK) can sufficiently improve FEV<sub>1</sub> in a few days and plateaus in about 2 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). It is possible that this group also includes some patients with other chronic pulmonary diseases, such as KOPB and chronic bronchiolitis.</p>
         <p>In literature the most frequently listed main reasons for uncontrolled asthma are poor patient adherence and mistakes in the use of inhaler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). 53.3% of patients participating in our study took their medications regularly. Assessing adherence based on the difference between medications issued and medications used, as taken from the electronic prescription database, is a rough method that often overestimates medication adherence. In clinical studies the most often used method is inspecting returned inhalers for the amounts of medication used, or the inhaler’s weight. Recently, inhalers with electronic counters have become available, which log the time of activation and the efficacy of the inhaler application. The low share of patients (16.7%) with a poor technique of using the inhaler is encouraging. In the past few years we created good conditions in Slovenia for the patients to learn the correct inhaler use technique, both in specialist clinics and in primary level reference clinics. The inhaler usage technique must be consistently checked during control examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The most frequent factor that can be related to uncontrolled asthma in our study were comorbidities, especially obesity, rhinosinusitis and GERD. Lowering one’s body weight improves asthma control, the pulmonary functions, the quality of life and the consumption of medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The connection between the upper and lower respiratory tract in asthma has been recognized for a long time. Treating a comorbid allergic rhinitis or a chronic rhinosinusitis, especially when it is connected with nasal polyposis, improves asthma control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Most epidemiology studies show that at least 80% of asthma patients also have a nasal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).  After a professional assessment by our specialists we discovered chronic rhinosinusitis as a significant potential risk factor for uncontrolled asthma with only 28.8% of patients. This group especially included patients with frequent or constant nasal symptoms, for whom therapy with medications and/or surgery was not successful enough. Treatment of patients with asthma and GERD with a proton pump inhibitor is especially successful with those patients with clear GERD symptoms and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). For more than a half of patients the presence of specific triggers was a factor that may be related to uncontrolled asthma. The main factors in this group are medications (mostly ACE inhibitors), exposure to allergens, and in a lesser scope also smoking. Even though Slovenian and international GINA guidelines list ACE inhibitors among medications that could pose a risk for uncontrolled asthma, there is no direct proof for this in literature. In a smaller share of asthma patients, ACE inhibitors may cause coughing, and should therefore not be administered any more. The study included adult patients of all ages. With age the number of comorbidities for asthma patients increases, and with this also the need to treat them. Checking the medications that an asthma patient constantly takes to treat comorbidities, and replacing them with safer options where possible, is a necessary measure for good asthma control. Allergens in the home or work environment can be completely or partially avoided. A patient with mild or moderate asthma can be treated with specific immunotherapy. Smoking decreases the efficiency of medicating with inhaled glucocorticoids, so patients must be encouraged to quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p>
         <p>Uncontrolled asthma increases the risk for exacerbation in and of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Other significant factors for exacerbation that are unrelated to the level of asthma control include: one or several exacerbations in the past year, poor adherence, incorrect inhaler use, chronic rhinosinusitis and smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In our sample of patients with uncontrolled asthma fewer than 30% of them suffered from one or more severe exacerbations. Regression analysis showed that the most important factors related to severe exacerbations in the past year are: not understanding the role of preventive and controller medications and if the physician did not issue a plan for asthma self-management. Understanding the role of asthma medications is one of key elements for obtaining the asthma control. It must be included in the medical training of the physician and the nurse who treat the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Teaching asthma self-management includes 3 components: the patient’s assessment of symptoms and the maximum air flow at exhalation, written instructions for regular management, recognizing and taking action at an asthma exacerbation, and regular check-ups of asthma control, how the management is going and assessment of the correct inhaler use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). All asthma patients should receive asthma self-management training.</p>
         <p>Uncontrolled asthma is not a synonym for severe asthma. By removing factors that can cause uncontrolled asthma most patients can bring their asthma under control. The reason for severe asthma is not in the above factors for uncontrolled asthma, but in the nature of the disease. There is not much data on the global prevalence of severe asthma. Experts estimate that about 5–10% of asthma patients have severe asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). According to the Dutch observational study this number is even lower at 4.5%. In our study the estimated share of severe asthma in the sample of adult patients with uncontrolled asthma is 22.9%. Taking into account the 38% prevalence of uncontrolled asthma in Slovenia, as discovered in the previous study, the share of severe asthma patients in Slovenia is at least 8%.</p>
         <p>Even though the study was conducted on a select population of patients with uncontrolled asthma in outpatient pulmonary clinics, we believe that the sample is representative, as the selected clinics were equally distributed across Slovenia. The study included both the patients who had been treated in specialist clinics for a while, as well as those who were referred there from the primary care level because of uncontrolled asthma. Family physicians most often refer patients with uncontrolled asthma to a specialist. Naturally, this means that a potential smaller share of patients with uncontrolled asthma treated at the primary level was not included. The study was conducted in the winter and the spring, when the rate of respiratory tract infections is the highest. Patients who suffered from an asthma exacerbation or a respiratory infection in the past month, were not included in the study. A major advantage of the study is a comprehensive assessment of risk factors for uncontrolled asthma. Besides assessing adherence and the inhaler application technique, which are most often used in studies, we also added comorbidities and specific triggers.</p>
         <p>The weaknesses of this study include the possibility of an incorrect subjective professional assessment by the specialist, especially when assessing the correctness of inhaler application technique, assessing specific triggers for uncontrolled asthma, and assessing the suitability of current therapy for asthma treatment.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Our study confirmed that from the sample of adult patients at out-patient pulmonary clinics across Slovenia the most frequent factors related to uncontrolled asthma are comorbidities, specific triggers and poor patient adherence. A third of patients with uncontrolled asthma still have at least one severe exacerbation per year in spite of treatment. Not understanding the role of medications and the absence of an individualized self-management plan are the most significant reasons for severe exacerbations. In the future asthma patients will have to be trained better and for each one an individualized asthma self-management plan will have to be prepared.</p>
