			<h1 class="abs">Abstract</h1>
			<p class="abs">Acute bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in children under two years of age. Treatment of acute bronchiolitis is supportive, i.e. application of oxygen to children with hypoxaemia and care for proper hydration. The value obtained by pulse oximetry is merely an indirect measurement of the actual oxygen level in the blood and does not reflect the severity of the disease. By the application of oxygen we only correct hypoxaemia, but do not treat the underlying cause. Nevertheless, as there is no clinical sign that would precisely define children with hypoxaemia, pulse oximetry remains the decisive investigation in decision-making about oxygen application. Studies have shown that when assessing the severity of the disease, pediatricians trust the values of oxygen saturation (SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub>) rather than the clinical assessment. Since pulse oximetry has been in use, the percentage of hospitalised patients due to acute bronchiolitis has increased by about 250 %. Guidelines for treating children with acute bronchiolitis are not consistent in terms of specifying a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> cut-off value that requires oxygen therapy. In this review we have critically evaluated these guidelines and presented our own experience regarding oxygen treatment of acute bronchiolitis.</p>

			<h1><span>1 </span>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Acute bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in children younger than two years. Although it is usually a self-limited disease treated in the outpatient paediatric setting, it represents the leading cause of hospitalisation in infants below one year of age&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. Over the past 30 years the number of hospital admissions related to acute bronchiolitis has dramatically increased. There are various causes for this situation, yet the two most important ones seem to be the use of pulse oximetry and absence of clear definition for clinically important hypoxemia&#160;<span class="xref">(2,3)</span></p>
			<p>Because of the great burden of disease affecting children, numerous studies have been undertaken with the aim to improve the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. They showed that there is currently no medication that would shorten or affect the course of the disease. Therefore, supplemental oxygen administration and care for proper hydration remain the only treatment option available in these children&#160;<span class="xref">(2,3)</span></p>
			<p>This survey paper presents mechanisms underlying the development of hypoxaemia in children with acute broncholitis, provides guidance on when and how oxygen therapy should be initiated, discusses advantages and limitations of pulse oximetry, and gives recommendations for the management of these children using oxygen therapy.</p>
			<h1><span>2 </span>Pathophysiological basis of the disease</h1>
			<p>Acute bronchiolitis is a viral lower respiratory tract infection affecting children younger than two years. The disease is spread through droplets in the air. After the incubation period and previous signs of upper respiratory tract infection, approximately one-third of children develop inflammation of small air passages, called bronchioles. Based on the history and clinical assessment, and according to the degree of the disease severity, acute bronchiolitis in children is divided into mild, moderate and severe disease (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>).</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Bronchiole blocking occurs as a result of apoptosis of bronchiolar epithelial cells, accumulation of inflammatory cells, oedema and increased mucus production. Air trapping behind the blocked bronchiole leads to lung hyperinflation. After absorption of the trapped air, localised atelectasis form distal to the blocking. Insufficiently ventilated atelectatic area and presence of unchanged perfusion lead to a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, the main mechanism behind the development of hypoxaemia in children with acute bronchiolitis.</p>
			<p>Hypoxaemia is caused by important V/Q mismatch, and to a lesser degree, by reduced rate of gas diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane. According to the Fick‘s law of diffusion, gas diffusion rate is directly proportional to the diffusion surface area and the difference in partial gas pressures, and inversely proportional to the diffusion distance. In acute bronchiolitis, the above mentioned pathological and physiological mechanisms are responsible for an increase in the diffusion distance, leading to a decreased oxygen diffusion rate&#160;<span class="xref">(4,5</span><span class="xref">)</span>. Under normal physiological conditions, partial pressure of gas in alveolar capillaries (PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub>) becomes practically equal to alveolar gas pressure (PAO<sub class="sub">2</sub>), when blood reaches about one-third of the distance along capillaries. In acute bronchiolitis, however, this values are attained later or not at all, as indicated by increased difference between PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub> and PAO<sub class="sub">2</sub>&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>.</p>
			<p>Oxygen supplementation corrects hypoxaemia to some degree, but cannot eliminate it because it does not address its underlying cause. Oxygen therapy increases PAO<sub class="sub">2</sub> and improves the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and diffusion of oxygen, but fails to improve V/Q mismatch&#160;<span class="xref">(5)</span>.</p>
			<p>A specific feature of oxygen carried in the blood is its capacity to bind to haemoglobin: 98 % of oxygen is bound to haemoglobin and only 2 % is dissolved in the blood. Haemoglobin affinity for oxygen is not linear, therefore the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve has a specific sigmoid shape (<span class="ref-fig">Figure </span><span class="ref-fig">1</span>). The curve flattens off as haemoglobin molecules approach full oxygen saturation. In this segment of the curve only minimal changes in blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub>) levels occur despite significant changes in PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer004" class="figure-wrapper">

					<p class="caption"><bold class="blue">Figure 1:</bold> Oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve and curve shifts in particular conditions (based on West JB&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Since SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> 90 % lies on the end plateau portion of the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve, a further decrease in oxygen saturation causes a sharp drop in PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels. There is some controversy over the exact cut-off value below which clinically relevant hypoxaemia ensues, yet some investigators believe that a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> of 90 % does not represent an arbitrary but rather a physiological, i.e. clinically relevant cut-off value of important hypoxaemia. In the absence of the leftward shift, an oxygen saturation over 90 % is regarded as an indicator of appropriate blood oxygen saturation&#160;<span class="xref">(7)</span>.</p>
			<p>Patients with acute bronchiolitis often have concomitant conditions, such as increased body temperature, decreased pH in the blood and increased PCO<sub class="sub">2</sub> and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which shift the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. This physiological right shift reduces haemoglobin affinity for oxygen. It enhances transport of oxygen to peripheral tissues, but decreases oxygen uptake by pulmonary capillaries. This should always be borne in mind when treating children with acute bronchiolitis&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>.</p>
			<p>Children younger than two years often have anaemia, which tends to worsen with infection. As a result of reduced blood oxiform capacity, the shape of haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve changes, which means that blood oxygen levels can be decreased despite appropriate PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub> and SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>.</p>
			<p>The term hypoxaemia denotes decreased PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels while tissue hypoxia refers to insufficient oxygen supply at the tissue level. The latter leads to impaired function of an organ or the whole organism, and is potentially life-threatening. It is important to know that the terms are not interchangeable. Oxygen diffusion gradient at the capillary level is very low (= 4 kPa), which suggests that peripheral tissues can tolerate very low oxygen levels. Studies <italic class="em">in vitro</italic> have shown normal utilisation of oxygen by tissues even with PaO2 levels of 0.7 kPa&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>3 </span>Pulse oximetry</h1>
			<p>Pulse oximetry began to be used in medicine in the 1980s. SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> determined using pulse oximetry is only an indirect measurement of PaO<sub class="sub">2</sub>, which can be measured directly by arterial blood gas analysis. SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels do not delineate the severity of the illness&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>. The measured SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> value reflects the level of oxygenation but provides no information on ventilation or acid-base balance. Moreover, normal SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> values do not rule out a possible increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub class="sub">2</sub>) in infants.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, pulse oximetry readings remain an important factor in the decision to use oxygen therapy in infants with lower respiratory tract infection asthere is no clinical sign or symptom that would accurately define hypoxaemia in these patients&#160;<span class="xref">(9)</span>.</p>
			<p>It should be noted that pulse oximetry has several limitations. As shown by a prospective observational study of mechanically ventilated children carried out in the USA, the reliability of the investigation is lowest in the hypoxaemic SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> range of 76 % to 90 %&#160;<span class="xref">(10)</span>. In this SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> range, arterial oxygen saturation is overestimated by 3 % – 5 %. There is a need for better algorithms to assess oxygen saturation in this hypoxaemic range. On the other hand a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> level of &gt; 91 % is considered to represent a good approximation to true blood oxygen levels&#160;<span class="xref">(10)</span>.</p>
			<p>In addition, research has shown that paediatricians assessing the severity of illness in infants rely on SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels to a greater extent than on actual clinical assessment&#160;<span class="xref">(11)</span>. Since the introduction of pulse oximetry, there has been a 250 % increase in the hospitalisation rate of infants with acute bronchiolitis&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. In a randomised double-blind study, Schuh et al. showed that a minimal change in SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels (of only a few percent) can have a decisive influence on the paediatrician‘s decision about acute bronchiolitis management. The study involved children with mild to moderate acute bronchiolitis and true SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels above 87 %. It was found that hospitalisation rates were by nearly 20 % lower (41 % vs. 25 %, p = 0.005) in children whose SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels determined by a pulse oximeter with a modified algorithm were by 3 % higher than their true SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels&#160;<span class="xref">(11)</span>.</p>
			<p>Moreover, hospitalisations tend to be prolonged, not because of clinical deteriorations, but as a result of monitoring SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> by pulse oximetry. In their retrospective study and review of hospital records of children hospitalised for acute bronchiolitis, Schroeder at al. determined the extent to which hospital stay was prolonged on the basis of SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> readings, provided that all other criteria for discharge, including adequate food and fluid intake, were met. The length of hospital stay was prolonged on average for 1.6 day in one-fourth of children (26 %)&#160;<span class="xref">(12)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>4 </span>Normal SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub></h1>
			<p>In order to determine a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> cut-off level indicating hypoxaemia, the reference range of SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> values for a normal and healthy children population had to be defined. Studies have shown a very wide range of normal SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> values&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>. In addition, transient desaturation (SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> of &lt; 90 % ) episodes, occuring particularly during sleep, are common in children&#160;<span class="xref">(14)</span>, and have no impact on their further development&#160;<span class="xref">(15)</span>. Yet, transient hypoxaemia episodes occuring over several months or even years in children with sleep-related breathing disorders, and long-term high-altitude hypoxaemia or hypoxaemia associated with congenital heart disease may have adverse effects on neurocognitive functioning&#160;<span class="xref">(16)</span>.</p>
			<p>Transient and clinically insignificant desaturations (SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> &lt; 90 %) are common in children suffering from acute bronchiolitis. McCulloh et al., who used continuous pulse oximetry in children with acute bronchiolitis, found that they had frequent transient desaturations, which, however, required no initiation or escalation of oxygen therapy&#160;<span class="xref">(17)</span>. In Slovene hospitals, these desaturation episodes probably tend to be overlooked because of the use of intermittent pulse oximetry monitoring.</p>
			<p>A prospective cohort study by Principi et al. showed that desaturations with a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> below 90 % occur frequently in children with acute bronchiolitis during the recovery period, i.e. after discharge home. Desaturation was defined as a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> below 90 %, sustained for at least one minute. At least one such desaturation episode was recorded in 64 % of children within 72 hours after discharge home, the longest episode lasting nearly nine minutes. There was no difference between children with oxygen desaturation and those without it in terms of illness deterioration, i.e. rate of hospital readmissions. Usually, children had desaturation episodes while sleeping or eating&#160;<span class="xref">(18)</span>.</p>
			<p>There is a lack of studies on potential long-term effects of mild hypoxaemia associated with bronchiolitis on neurocognitive development in children. Given that completely normal, healthy children may show occasional transient desaturations with a SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> below 90 %&#160;<span class="xref">(14)</span>, it can be assumed that mild acute hypoxaemia associated with bronchiolitis has no significant impact on brain development in these children.</p>
			<h1><span>5 </span>Risks of oxygen therapy</h1>
			<p>Children are given supplemental oxygen to improve organ oxygenation and prevent tissue hypoxia. Yet, careful titration of oxygen therapy is required because of the risk of tissue hyperoxaemia. While the consequences of tissue hypoxia leading to cell death are well known, recent studies have shown that hyperoxaemia exerts harmful effects, too. Numerous studies in animals and healthy volunteers have demonstrated that breathing high-concentration oxygen may lead to lung tissue damage&#160;<span class="xref">(19)</span>. The degree of this damage is directly associated with the concentration of the inhaled oxygen and the exposure time. It rarely occurs with FiO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels below 0.5, i.e. when the child is breathing oxygen-enriched air with an oxygen saturation of 50 %&#160;<span class="xref">(19)</span>.</p>
			<p>Investigations, conducted mainly in mechanically ventilated patients, showed that excessive oxygen leads to increased production of oxygen free radicals. High oxygen intake causes oxidative stress and the resulting cell death and inflammatory response&#160;<span class="xref">(20)</span>.</p>
			<p>Under normal conditions, arterial PCO<sub class="sub">2</sub> plays a key role in the control of breathing. In patients with severe lung disease and chronic hypercapnia, hypoxaemia is the main factor addressed to improve breathing. High-concentration oxygen may impair respiratory centre function and worsen hypercapnia. In these group of patients appropriate assessment of ventilation status should therefore be based on arterial blood gas analysis and PCO<sub class="sub">2</sub> determination&#160;<span class="xref">(21)</span>.</p>
			<p>Careful titration of oxygen therapy as with other medications is required to prevent unintended adverse effects of hypo- or hyperoxia&#160;<span class="xref">(20,22)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>6 </span>Guidelines of acute bronchiolitis management</h1>
			<p>Cut-off values of clinically important hypoxaemia have not yet been defined. Therefore, there is some discrepancy between the established guidelines for the management of children with acute bronchiolitis in terms of SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> cut-off levels requiring oxygen therapy. The clinical practice guideline published by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that clinicians inititate oxygen therapy only when SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> is less than 90 %, because transient hypoxaemic episodes are not associated with complications&#160;<span class="xref">(23)</span>.</p>
			<p>The NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline, however, recommends that children receive oxygen supplementation when they have oxygen saturation of less than 92 %, and that during treatment SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> should be maintained at &gt; 94 %&#160;<span class="xref">(24)</span>.</p>
			<p>A randomised controlled study by Cunningham et al. compared two groups of children, in whom oxygen therapy was initiated at SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> of &lt; 90 % and &lt; 94 %, respectively&#160;<span class="xref">(25)</span>. This multicentre study was conducted in eight hospitals in Great Britain between 2012 and 2013 and involved 615 children, between six weeks and 12 months of age. The infants were randomly allocated to two groups: in one group, oxygen saturation was measured with a standard pulse oximeter (n = 308) and in another with a modified pulse oximeter (n = 307) with an adjusted algorithm. The measured SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels in the latter group were higher than their true levels, i.e. 94 % instead of 90 %. SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels between 85 % and 100 % were adjusted accordingly. It was agreed that in both groups oxygen supplementation was started when the oxygen saturation reading on the pulse oximeter monitor was less than 94 %. As expected, oxygen was administered to fewer children monitored with a modified pulse oximeter as compared to those monitored with a standard device (56 % vs. 73 %). In addition, the duration of oxygen supplementation was shorter in the modified pulse oximetry group than in the group monitored with a standard pulse oximeter (6 hrs vs. 28 hrs ) and so was the length of hospital stay (30 hrs vs. 44 hrs). Surprisingly, children in whom oxygen therapy was started at oxygen saturation levels of &lt; 90 % showed even a more favourable course of illness. In these children, appropriate feeding was started three hours earlier, as reported by their parents they were free of symptoms one day earlier, and they had a lower rate of readmissions for exacerbation of the disease within 28 days of discharge. The groups had comparable rates of unfavourable outcomes. The investigators concluded that oxygen therapy initiated at an oxygen saturation of 90 % is as safe as that started at an oxygen saturation of less than 94 %. Although the study shows with great reliability that short-term oxygen supplementation at SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels of &lt; 90 % is safe, its long-term effects on neurocognitive and personality development are not yet fully understood.</p>
			<p>All current guidelines favour the use of intermittent over continuous pulse oximetry for SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> determination in children hospitalised for acute bronchiolitis.</p>
			<p>According to the NICE guidelines, children are ready for discharge when their oxygen saturation is &gt; 92 %, and after they had been without supplemental oxygen for at least four hours, including sleep episode&#160;<span class="xref">(24)</span>, or as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, when their SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> is ≥ 90 % and their food and fluid intake is adequate&#160;<span class="xref">(23)</span>. After re-establishement of normal eating patterns, deterioration of respiratory function occurs very rarely&#160;<span class="xref">(26)</span>.</p>
			<p>Cunningham et al. compared two guideline recommendations for discharge, i.e. stable oxygen saturation of ≥ 90 %, or SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> of ≥ 94 % for at least four hours&#160;<span class="xref">(27)</span>.</p>
			<p>They studied 68 infants aged up to 18 months, treated with oxygen supplementation for acute bronchiolitis. Normal feeding (meeting &gt; 75 % of normal nutritional requirements for their age and weight) was re-established at a median of 11 hours, SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> ≥ 90 % at 17 hours and SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> ≥ 94 % at 63 hours. The infants resumed normal eating and achieved a stable SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> of ≥ 90 % 22 hours sooner than a stable SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> of ≥ 94 %. Accepting lower SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels at discharge would significantly reduce the length of hospital stay for children with acute bronchiolitis requiring oxygen therapy (average - 3 days)&#160;<span class="xref">(27</span><span class="xref">)</span>, but it would require potential negative clinical effects to be studied beforehand&#160;<span class="xref">(25)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>7 </span>Management of acute bronchiolitis with high-flow oxygen delivery</h1>
			<p>Hypoxaemic infants with bronchiolitis receive oxygen through a nasal cannula or face mask. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy involves delivery of humidified heated high-flow gas mixture through an adjusted two-prong nasal cannula. As compared to a standard nasal cannula, this cannula allows titration of oxygen percentage and gas flow rate, and appropriate oxygene supplementation in patients with profound hypoxaemia. In addition, HFNC oxygen therapy provides a higher level of respiratory support: under proper conditions in the upper respiratory tract it creates positive end-expiratory pressure&#160;<span class="xref">(28)</span>. This treatment modality was first established in the field of neonatology: it was used for the management of respiratory distress and respiratory pauses in preterm infants&#160;<span class="xref">(29)</span>. Many studies to date have shown HFNC oxygen therapy to be an efficient option for treating children with acute bronchiolitis&#160;<span class="xref">(</span><span class="xref">30)</span>. Acute bronchiolitis is characterised by nonhomogenous pulmonary ventilation leading to an increase in V/Q mismatch and hypoxaemia&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. Because of its beneficial effects on pathological changes this non-invasive modality is considered as one of treatment options in children with severe bronchiolitis&#160;<span class="xref">(28)</span>. The introduction of HFNC oxygen therapy in ICUs has significantly reduced the need for invasive ventilatory support&#160;<span class="xref">(31,32)</span>. HFNC oxygen therapy has been increasingly used also in hospital paediatric wards because of its beneficial effects in children with severe acute bronchiolitis. A recent multicentre randomised controlled study showed that as compared to standard oxygen therapy, the use of HFNC oxygen therapy outside ICU settings has significantly reduced ICU admissions&#160;<span class="xref">(33)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>8 </span>Management of acute bronchiolitis by oxygen supplementation at the Unit of Pulmonary Diseases, Division of Paediatrics Ljubljana</h1>
			<p>According to the protocol of oxygen supplementation in children and adolescents, prepared by the Unit of Pulmonary Diseases, Division of Paediatrics, Ljubljana&#160;<span class="xref">(34)</span>, oxygen therapy for acute bronchiolitis is started if a child has an oxygen saturation of ≤ 92 % (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 2</span>). Oxygen supplementation can be initiated at SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels of 92 % to 94 % in severly ill children showing the following signs and symptoms: reduced hydration (&lt; 50 % of normal fluid intake for the past 24 hours), history of respiratory pauses, respiratory rate higher than normal for the age group, substantially increased work of breathing, cyanosis and exhaustion.<a id="_idTextAnchor000"></a></p>

			<p>Oxygen is considered to be a drug and requires a medical prescription in all but emergency situations, in which oxygen therapy should be initiated without delay. Target SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> range should be included as part of the patient‘s oxygen prescription. The nurse who administers oxygen should achieve the prescribed target saturation range. After oxygen administration, SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels should be measured at regular intervals together with other parameters of the work of breathing, i.e. respiratory rate and subjective assessment of respiratory effort. Regular measurements and monitoring of oxygen saturation in a child are required before starting oxygen therapy or after its discontinuation. If target SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels of oxygen administered by an oxygen delivery device are exceeded, the nurse should gradually step down the inhaled oxygen concentration until oxygen therapy is finally discontinued&#160;<span class="xref">(34)</span>.</p>
			<p>HFNC oxygen therapy has been used at the Unit of Pulmonary Diseases, Division of Paediatrics since 2011. Its beneficial clinical effects were demonstrated by a prospective, observational study of infants less than 24 months of age suffering from hypoxaemic respiratory distress associated with acute bronchiolitis. This therapeutic intervention significantly reduced their respiratory and heart rates and improved their respiratory effort parameters. There was also a simultanous increase in pH values and a decrease in PCO<sub class="sub">2</sub> in the capillary blood&#160;<span class="xref">(35</span><span class="xref">)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>9 </span>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Pulse oximetry is a very useful non-invasive procedure, yet the measured SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels do not always reflect the true severity of the disease. Moreover, pulse oximetry provides the least accurate results for the oxygen saturation range of 76 % –90 %. Therefore, paediatricians treating children with acute bronchiolitis must not overrely on the measured oxygen saturation levels. The assessment of disease severity and the diagnosis should be based on accurate medical history and physical examination data. It has been shown that overreliance on SpO<sub class="sub">2</sub> levels leads to increased hospitalisation rates and prolonged length of hospital stay in children with acute bronchiolitis.</p>
			<p>Oxygen should be treated as all other drugs. Prescription of oxygen therapy and appropriate oxygen administration and titration are required to prevent potential adverse effects of hypo- or hyperoxaemia. At the Unit of Pulmonary Diseases, Division of Paediatrics, Ljubljana, oxygen supplementation is started when a child has an oxygen saturation of ≤ 92 %. If risk factors for hypoxaemia are identified on the basis of medical history or clinical findings, oxygen therapy can be intitiated sooner, i.e. at an oxygen saturation rate of 92 %–94 %.</p>
			<p>Research has shown that HFNC oxygen therapy is an effective respiratory support modality in children with acute bronchiolitis that can significantly decrease the number of children requiring invasive respiratory support. Since clearly defined guidelines for the use of HFNC oxygen therapy are not yet available, a decision to start oxygen therapy is made on the basis of clinical assessment and available equipment.</p>
