			<h1 class="abs">Abstract</h1>
			<p class="abs">Erythrocytosis is a condition characterised by increased red blood cell mass in the body. Patients usually present with increased haematocrit, increased haemoglobin concentration and an increased number of red blood cells. Erythrocytosis can be absolute or relative. Absolute erythrocytosis is either primary or secondary, both groups are further divided into congenital and acquired. The characterisation is often problematic and aetiology remains unknown in many patients, resulting in an entity called “idiopathic erythrocytosis”. The aim of this article is to improve the diagnostic methods for erythrocytosis by including further genetic testing into routine clinical practice.</p>
			<p class="abs">We propose an extended and detailed algorithm for diagnosis of erythrocytosis. We describe the classification of various forms of erythrocytoses, their clinical presentation, genetic background, diagnostic methods and treatment options. By reviewing the 5-year period of <italic class="em">JAK2</italic> mutation testing (the first laboratory test performed in a patient with erythrocytosis) we obtained better insight into the prevalence of the disease in Slovenia.</p>

			<h1><span>1 </span>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The production of red blood cells in the body (erythropoiesis) is a tightly controlled process of maintaining the normal mass of red blood cells needed to satisfy the needs of oxygen delivery to all tissues. Different disorders may lead to erythrocytosis, a conditions with an increased red cell mass. This is reflected by an increase in haematocrit (Ht) and haemoglobin (Hb) levels and a higher red blood cell count. The term polycythemia has been incorrectly used as a synonym for erythrocytosis. Polycythemia refers to an increase in the number of three types of blood cells&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>.</p>
			<p>Firstly, we should always differentiate between absolute or real erythrocythosis from relative or false or pseudo erythrocythosis. This is not always simple, as there is no direct link between the concentration of haemoglobin, haematocrit and red cell mas in the body&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. Absolute erythrocytosis represents an increase in the total volume/mass by over 25 % over normal mass or an increase in the concentration of haemoglobin and haematocrit on at least two separate occasions with an interval of at least 2 months. In relative erythrocytosis, total red blood cell volume/mass is normal, as the haematocrit and the concentration of haemoglobin are increased on account of lower plasma volume (e.g. with dehydration)&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. The following text focuses on absolute erythrocytosis.</p>
			<p><italic class="em">Classification of erythrocytosis</italic>. Considering their origin, there are divided into primary and secondary, and both groups are further divided into congenital and acquired (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>). <italic class="em">Primary </italic>refers to independent or autonomous proliferation of red blood cells in the bone marrow, which is the result of congenital or acquired mutation in the gene regulating erythropoiesis (i.e. intrinsic red cell disorder). This group typically has lower concentration of erythropoietin (EPO) in the blood. Therefore, erythropoiesis is independent of lower EPO concentration. <italic class="em">Congenital erythrocytosis</italic> is present at birth and is mostly inherited as the same changes are found in other members of the same family (familial disease); they are rarely sporadic when an individual develops a new mutation. <italic class="em">Acquired</italic> <italic class="em">erythrocytosis</italic> can develop anytime in life&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. The most common primary acquired erythrocytosis is polycythaemia vera (PV), which is a non-leukemic myeloproliferative neoplasm&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. Only primary congenital erythrocytosis is associated with a faulty erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) due to a mutation in the <italic class="em">EPOR </italic>gene (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>)<italic class="em">.</italic></p>

					<p class="caption"><bold class="blue">Figure 1:</bold> Presentation of pathway and genes involved in the development of familial erythrocytosis.</p>
					<p class="caption">A. Renal cells produce EPO as a response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia). HIF2α is the ‘main sensor’ for detecting oxygen in the cell. Under normoxic conditions, PHD2 hydroxylates HIFα proteins, thus facilitating VHL binding and subsequent degradation. Therefore, HIFα levels are low under normoxic conditions. An anomaly in any of the involved proteins may prevent HIFα degradation and cause it to accumulate in the cell, as is the case in hypoxia. As HIF2α is not hydroxylated, VHL cannot bind to it. This prevents degradation of HIFα, which translocates into the nucleus, where it binds with HIF2B and works as a transcription factor for different genes, including EPO. Cells begin to synthesise EPO and release it in the blood.</p>
					<p class="caption">B. Erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow have an EPO receptor (EPOR) on their cell surface. The binding of EPO to the receptor induces a cascade of signals, leading to the transduction of numerous genes involved in the growth, proliferation and differentiation of these cells, which leads to accelerated production of new red blood cells.</p>
					<p class="caption">C. Haemoglobin binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it into tissues in the presence of bisphosphoglycerate. Mutations in several genes (<italic class="em">HBB, HBA, BPGM</italic>) increase oxygen-Hb affinity and reduce the release in the tissue (from Bento et al)&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>.</p>

			</div>
			<p><italic class="em">Secondary erythrocytosis</italic> is caused by a disorder independent of bone marrow accelerating erythropoiesis through raised EPO or a different mechanism&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>. Such patients have normal or elevated concentrations of EPO in the blood. <italic class="em">Congenital secondary erythrocytosis</italic> are caused by genetic mutations for proteins involved in oxygen sensing in the blood and proteins that affect the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>). <italic class="em">Acquired secondary erythrocytoses </italic>are associated with diseases and conditions accompanied by hypoxemia or inadequate excessive production of EPO. These include heart and lung diseases with hypoxemia, renal conditions involving inadequate EPO production or extrinsic causes, such as living at high altitudes, smoking, carbon monoxide poisoning, etc.&#160;<span class="xref">(5,6)</span>. Secondary erythrocytoses can also be caused by taking drugs, such as diuretics, androgen hormones, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or recombinant EPO&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. These are the most common.</p>
			<p>When no cause can be identified, the condition is termed <italic class="em">idiopathic erythrocytosis</italic>. Over 70 % of erythrocytoses with a suspected familiar or genetic background have no clear genetic background&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>.</p>
			<p>In Slovenia, routine molecular diagnostics of polycytemia vera has been performed at a Specialised haematology laboratory of the Clinical Department of Haematology at the Ljubljana Medical Centre&#160;<span class="xref">(7)</span> and also at Maribor Medical Centre. We do not yet have the option to identify primary and secondary congenital (familial) erythrocytosis, which has been routinely identified in several bigger laboratories across the world (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>). However, the method is being introduced.</p>
			<h1><span>2 </span>Clinical manifestation of patients with erythrocytosis</h1>
			<p>Patients with erythrocytosis usually have plethoric appearance. They may have signs of hyperviscosity (headache, vertigo, nose bleeds, blurred vision, dyspnoea with exertion, fatigue, paraesthesia, chest and abdominal pain, myalgia and weakness) or are without symptoms&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. In a patient complaining of pruritus, particularly after bathing, erythromelalgia, gout, history of arterial or venous thrombosis, bleeding or abdominal tension due to enlarged spleen PV should be suspected.&#160;<span class="xref">(7)</span>.</p>
			<p>Sleepiness during the day and loud snoring are also typical of obstructive sleep apnoea, common in obese persons with BMI &gt; 30 kg/m&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. Chronic carboxyhaemoglobinaemia in smokers and workers exposed to carbon monoxide can also cause secondary acquired erythrocytosis.</p>
			<p>If erythrocytosis is the result of pulmonary disease, respiratory problems are present (shortness of breath, dyspnoea with exertion, chronic cough, barrel chest, cyanosis, digital clubbing). Renal artery stenosis is presented with high blood pressure and erythrocytosis due to tissue hypoxia. Erythrocytosis has also been associated with polycystic kidney disease. It may also be linked to liver cysts and dysfunction. 10–15 % patients after renal transplant have transient erythrocytosis. Raised levels of EPO in the body may also be the result of paraneoplastic manifestation&#160;associated with different tumours, which can be asymptomatic. (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>). It also develops in treatment with androgens and abuse of recombinant EPO&#160;<span class="xref">(4,8,9)</span>. The rare TEMPI syndrome is also associated with elevated EPO and consequently erythrocytosis. Other symptoms include monoclonal gammopathy, perinephric fluid collection and intrapulmonary shunting. Erythrocytosis is also found found in patients with POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes)&#160;<span class="xref">(2,7)</span>.</p>

			<p>Positive familial history or presentation in youth is significant to establish congenital forms of erythrocytosis. Clinical manifestation may vary; patients may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of hyperviscosity (headache, vertigo, epitaxies, dyspnoea with exertion, pruritus). Thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications are possible. Complications resulting in death due to arterial hypertension, intracranial bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, coronary disease and myocardial infarction have been reported in case of congenital erythrocytosis type 1 (ECYT1). Patients with congenital erythrocytosis type 2 (ECYT2, Chuvas polycythaemia) typically have red cheeks and low blood pressure, and may develop vertebral haemangiomas or varicose veins, and suffer from cerebral vascular events and peripheral thrombosis. Similarly, clinical presentation in patients with haemoglonopathy due to increased oxygen affinity varies from no symptoms to darker skin and mucosa, symptoms of hyperviscosity and thromboembolic events. A link between pheochromocytoma&#160;and&#160;paraganglioma with mutations in the oxygen sensation pathway has been reported. Patients with congenial erythrocytosis type 4 (ECYT4) are more prone to develop pulmonary hypertension&#160;<span class="xref">(3,9)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>3 </span>Genetic background of erythrocytosis</h1>
			<h2><span>3.1 </span>Primary erythrocytosis</h2>
			<p>Primary erythrocytosis is caused by a genetic anomaly in haemopoetic stem cells, which leads to cell oversensitivity to EPO and unregulated, excessive production of red blood cells. (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>B). The level of serum EPO is usually lowered, an occassionaly within the reference range (from 3.3 to 16.6 E/mL).</p>
			<h3><span>3.1.1 </span>Polycythaemia vera (mutation of the <italic class="em">JAK2</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>PV (OMIM 263300) is the most commonly acquired primary erythrocytosis. Janus kinasee 2 point mutation (<italic class="em">JAK2</italic>) c.1849G &gt; T in exon 14 (<italic class="em">JAK2</italic> V617F) or exon 12 changes the activity of JAK2 enzyme to make it independent of EPO. <italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>V617F mutation appears in 95 % of patients, while the exon 12 mutation is present in 3 %. Less common causes of PV include mutations in the <italic class="em">CALR,</italic> <italic class="em">TET2 </italic>and <italic class="em">EGLN1</italic>&#160;<span class="xref">(9,19)</span> genes. It is clear that neither <italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>V617F nor <italic class="em">CALR</italic> mutations are specific to PV. Only the presence of erythrocytosis distinguishes PV from other myeloproliferative neoplasms&#160;<span class="xref">(10)</span>.</p>
			<h3><span>3.1.2 </span>Familial erythrocytosis type 1 (mutation of the <italic class="em">EPOR</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Primary familial type 1 erythrocytosis (ECYT1, OMIM 133100) is caused by congenital mutation in the gene for the erythropoietin receptor (<italic class="em">EPOR</italic>). Familial erythrocytosis is also called congenital erythrocytosis (CE) or primary familial and congenital polycythaemia (PFCP)&#160;<span class="xref">(11)</span>. <italic class="em">EPOR </italic>gene mutation in exon 8 due to premature cessation of protein synthesis leads to a shorter receptor missing the binding point for SHP-1 regulation protein that regulates the activity of EPOR. Therefore, the receptor remains active for a longer period of time, which causes unregulated division of red blood cells. At least 18 mutations in the <italic class="em">EPOR</italic> gene lead to a shorter receptor and thereby erythrocytosis. Studies have shown that congenital erythrocytosis due to <italic class="em">EPOR </italic>mutation has autosomal dominant inheritance and unknown penetrance.</p>
			<h2><span>3.2 </span>Secondary erythrocytosis</h2>
			<p>Secondary erythrocytosis is caused by inappropriate regulation of erythropoiesis due to abnormalities in the oxygen sensation pathway in the kidneys or different affinity of oxygen for haemoglobin (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>A and <span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>C)&#160;<span class="xref">(3,9)</span>. Serum EPO level is normal or elevated.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.1 </span>Chuvash erythrocytosis (mutation of the <italic class="em">VHL</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Chuvash erythrocytosis or familial erythrocytosis type 2 (ECYT2, OMIM 263400) is caused by a mutation in the gene for Von-Hippel Lindau tumour suppressor protein (<italic class="em">VHL</italic>). A point mutation of the <italic class="em">VHL </italic>gene reduces the binding of the protein to HIF2α transcription factor and boosts EPO synthesis (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>A). Over 15 point mutations in the <italic class="em">VHL, </italic>gene, associated with the disease, are located on all three exons. Homozygotic mutation in the<italic class="em"> VHL</italic> C598T gene is common in a large group of individuals with erythrocytosis in the Chuvash region in Russia, where erythrocytosis is endemic. Over 100 individuals from over 80 families had usual Hb levels above 200 g/L, normal or elevated level of serum EPO and confirmed autosomal recessive inheritance. The same mutation was identified on Ischia island in Italy. Mutation <italic class="em">VHL</italic> c.571C &gt; G (p.(His191Asp) is typical of Croatia&#160;<span class="xref">(3,9)</span>. The genetic background in Slovenia is yet unknown.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.2 </span>Familial erythrocytosis type 3 (mutation of the <italic class="em">EGLN1</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Familial erythrocytosis type 3 (ECYT3, OMIM 6098202) is caused by a mutation in prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) enzyme inscribed on <italic class="em">EGLN1</italic> gene. Point mutation in the <italic class="em">EGLN1</italic> gene changes the form of the enzyme as it loses a unit crucial for binding or hydroxylating the HIF2α transcription factor, which boosts EPO synthesis (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>A)<italic class="em">. </italic>Over 15 point mutations in the <italic class="em">EGLN1</italic> gene associated with the disease are spread across the entire gene&#160;<span class="xref">(3,9)</span>.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.3 </span>Familial erythrocytosis type 4 (mutation in the <italic class="em">EPAS1</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Familial erythrocytosis type 4 (ECYT4, OMIM 611783) is caused by a mutation in the HIF2α transcription factor inscribed on <italic class="em">EPAS1</italic> gene. Point mutation in the <italic class="em">EPAS1 </italic>gene changes the form of the enzyme so it misses the unit crucial for binding the VHL or PHD2 protein. Therefore, HIF2α does not disintegrate but rather induces translation and synthesis of EPO (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>A). Most of the 9 point mutations in the <italic class="em">EPAS1</italic> gene associated with the disease are on exons 9, 12 and 19, most often on exon 12 on the binding spot of VHL protein&#160;<span class="xref">(3,9)</span>.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.4 </span>Familial erythrocytosis type 5 (mutation in the <italic class="em">EPO</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Familial erythrocytosis type 5 (ECYT5, OMIM 617907) is caused by a mutation in the gene for erythropoetin (<italic class="em">EPO</italic>), which leads to increased synthesis of this key erythropoiesis hormone. Point mutation in the promotor of the <italic class="em">EPO </italic>c.19delC gene was associated with the disease in two unconnected families for the first time in 2016&#160;<span class="xref">(12)</span>. Point deletion c.32delG in exon 2 is the latest mutation associated with the disease, discovered with 10 members of the same family in 2018&#160;<span class="xref">(13)</span>.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.5 </span>Familial erythrocytosis type 6 (mutation in the <italic class="em">HBB</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Familial erythrocytosis type 6 (ECYT6, OMIM 617980) is caused by a mutation in the gene for the haemoglobin beta (<italic class="em">HBB</italic>) subunit, which affects the increased affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. Over 80 point mutations in the <italic class="em">HBB </italic>gene associated with the disease are spread over the entire gene and have autosomal dominant inheritance.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.6 </span>Familial erythrocytosis type 7 (mutation in the <italic class="em">HBA</italic> gene)</h3>
			<p>Familial erythrocytosis type 7 (ECYT7, OMIM 617981) is caused by a mutation in the gene for the haemoglobin alfa 1 and alfa 2 subunits (<italic class="em">HBA1, HBA2</italic>) that affect the increased haemoglobin affinity for oxygen. 24 point mutations in the <italic class="em">HBA1 and HBA2</italic>,<italic class="em"> </italic>gene associated with the disease are spread over the entire gene.</p>
			<h3><span>3.2.7 </span>Mutation of bisphosphoglycerate mutase (<italic class="em">BPGM</italic>)</h3>
			<p>Another reason for increased oxygen-Hb affinity is the mutation in the gene for bisphosphoglycerate mutase (<italic class="em">BPGM</italic>), which causes deficiency of 2,3&#160;bisphospholycerate. This reduces the release of oxygen from Hb and its transition into tissues, which leads to hypoxia and compensatory erythrocytosis (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>C)&#160;<span class="xref">(9)</span>. Three point mutations in <italic class="em">BPGM</italic> have been linked to the disease so far. Compensatory erythrocytosis can also develop in congenital methemoglobinemia&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>4 </span>Diagnosis</h1>
			<p>Identification of a patient with erythrocytosis usually takes place in four key steps (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 2</span>):</p>
			<p class="ol"><span>1.</span>distinguishing absolute erythrocytosis from relative;</p>
			<p class="ol"><span>2.</span>distinguishing PV from secondary erythrocytosis and primary familial erythrocytosis (ECYT1);</p>
			<p class="ol"><span>3.</span>distinguishing secondary acquired from secondary familial erythrocytosis;</p>
			<p class="ol"><span>4.</span>identifying familial erythrocytosis.</p>
			<p><span class="ref-table">Table 2</span> can help to make a diagnosis. The basic test is the complete <italic class="em">blood count performed with a haematology analyser</italic>. Characteristic deviations from reference ranges that point to a possibility of erythrocytosis are: increased concentration of haemoglobin and/or haematocrit and elevated RBC concentration count. In erythrocytosis, other blood panel parametres are usual within the normal range.</p>

			<p><bold class="strong">Definition absolute/relative erythrocytosis.</bold> Absolute erythrocytosis is the result of increased RBC mass/volume in the body, which also increases the whole blood volume. A 60 % Ht in males and 56 % Ht in females practically always indicates absolute erythrocytosis&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>. Relative erythrocytosis is found in individuals with increased haematocrit yet normal RBC mass/volume due to decreased plasma volume (dehydration). RBC mass and blood volume measurements (radioisotope method) are not routinely performed, so patients should be tested and observed over a longer period. According to most authors, erythrocytosis should be identified in Ht values over 52 % in males and over 48 % in females.</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">Tests to confirm of exclude.</bold> According to the new categorisation of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) of World Health Organisation (WHO) from 2016 PV should be excluded with Hb concentration of &gt; 165 g/L (Ht &gt; 49 %) in males and Hb &gt; 160 g/L (Ht &gt; 48 %) in female if there are also one or more symptoms and signs of PV (cf. Clinical manifestation chapter)&#160;<span class="xref">(14)</span>. In addition to erythrocytosis in the blood count, confirmed presence of acquired (somatic) mutation in the <italic class="em">JAK2</italic> gene (<italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>V617F or exon 12), decreased serum concentration of EPO and/or typical bone marrow histological results are needed to confirm PV. Histological examination (bone marrow biopsy) is not needed only with positive mutation in <italic class="em">JAK2</italic>, lowered serum concentration of EPO and Hb values &gt; 185 g/L (Ht &gt; 55 %) in males or 165 g/L (Ht &gt; 49.5 %) in females. Mutation in <italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>V617F can be found in over 95 % of patients with PV. The mutation is not specific to PV and can be found in other MPNs: in some 50 % of cases with essential thrombocytemia and primary mielofibrosis and in a small share (&lt; 5 %) of cases with acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and other myeloid neoplasms. Mutation in the <italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>gene in exon 12<italic class="em"> </italic>occurs only in 3 % of PV patients, who are <italic class="em">JAK2</italic> V617F negative&#160;<span class="xref">(15)</span> and are typical of PV, and not confirmed in other MPNs.</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">EPO serum concentration </bold>helps determine if erythrocytosis is primary or secondary. Low serum concentration of a EPO is a highly specific indicator of PV. There have also been cases of familial erythrocytosis with low serum concentration of EPO due to activation mutation in the <italic class="em">EPOR</italic> gene. High serum concentrations of EPO can be observed in patients with secondary erythrocytosis caused by heart or pulmonary disease and EPO secreting tumours (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>). High serum concentration of EPO can also be the result of abuse of recombinant EPO (doping).</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">Pulse oximetry</bold> (SaO2) serves to assess the saturation of arterial blood with oxygen. SaO2 levels of 95 % or more indicate sufficient oxygen saturation in the arterial blood. When concentration is under 92 %, compensatory erythrocytosis occurs.</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) </bold>and separately <bold class="strong">oximetry </bold>(COHb, MetHb, O2Hb, Hb-HbO2) can be used to exclude chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. Most pulse oximeters doe not detect carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb),while methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is suspected when cyanosis is accompanied by low saturation on pulse oximetry and normal PaO2. Increased concentration of COHb or MetHb leads to tissue hypoxia and thereby erythrocytosis&#160;<span class="xref">(16)</span>. Compensatory erythrocytosis is caused by a 5 % share of COHb or more&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>. When saturation of arterial blood with oxygen is lowered, secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as heart and pulmonary disease, should be excluded (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>).</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">P50</bold> is the partial pressure of oxygen required to achieve 50 % saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen. Lowered p50 measured from a vein blood sample or determined from ABG is typical when the&#160;oxygen dissociation curve&#160;shifts to the left, which points to haemoglobin-oxygen affinity. This can be the result of elevated COHb, while rarely these are congenital haemoglobinopathies (haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity, bisphosphoglycerate deficiency and methemaglobinaemia)&#160;<span class="xref">(17)</span>.</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">Pathological liver test results </bold>may point to hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in patients with confirmed cirrhosis, viral hepatitis or hemochromatosis.</p>
			<p><bold class="strong">Protein analysis of haemoglobin </bold>(capillary electrophoresis) excluded the presence of haemoglobinopathies, which are hereditary disorders linked to irregularities in the quantity or structure of globin chains. The presence of haemoglobins with high oxygen affinity should also be suspected in patients with a family history of polycythaemia. It is also suspected in patients with lowered p50. Haemoglobins with high oxygen affinity are discovered in routine Hb electrophoresis only in 20–25 % of cases; in the remainder, fluid chromatography or haemoglobin gene sequencing is needed&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>.</p>
			<p>Microscopic haematuria, which may be the only sign of EPO-excreting renal carcinoma, may be discovered by <bold class="strong">urinalysis</bold>.</p>
			<p>Moreover, use/abuse of anabolic hormones should be excluded, as well as androgen-excreting tumours with appropriate imaging test. Transient erythrocytosis may sometimes occur after renal transplantation&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>.</p>
			<p>General biochemical blood testing should be performed and iron stores in the body with ferritin and transferrin saturation determined, which provides a general insight into a patient’s health&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>. If transferrin is highly saturated with iron, test should be performed to exclude haemocromatosis, although it is manifested by erythrocytosis only in exceptional cases.</p>
			<p>If acquired forms of erythrocytosis are excluded, genetic testing should be performed to confirm congenital primary and secondary erythrocytosis (<span class="ref-table">Table 1</span>, see chapter Genetic background of erythrocytosis). After excluding mutations typical of PV, the mutations in the <italic class="em">EPOR </italic>gene should be analysed, followed by an analysis of other genes associated with familial erythrocytosis (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 2</span>).</p>

			<p>When no known clinical reason for erythrocytosis can be identified, and available genetic testing is negative, patients are diagnosed as having idiopathic erythrocytosis.</p>
			<h1><span>5 </span><a id="_idTextAnchor000"></a>Treatment</h1>
			<p>The main goal of treating erythrocytosis is to manage clinical symptoms and signs of hyperviscosity, which may lead to thromboembolic complications and organ damage. Issues associated with hyperviscosity are often effectively alleviated with phlebotomy (blood drawing) to normalise RBC mass and blood viscosity. Patients are also often administered low-dose acetylsalicylic&#160;acid&#160;<span class="xref">(2,7)</span>.</p>
			<h2><span>5.1 </span>Treating patients with PV</h2>
			<p>PV patients are treated in accordance with a protocol that somewhat varies whether the patients are categorised as low- or high-risk for developing thrombosis&#160;<span class="xref">(14)</span>. Treatment includes regular phlebotomy, low-dose acetylsalicylic&#160;acid, cytoreductive therapy and, in recent years, administration of Ruxolitibin, a JAK2 inhibitor&#160;<span class="xref">(18-20)</span>.</p>
			<h2><span>5.2 </span>Treating patients with familial and idiopathic erythrocytosis</h2>
			<p>Treatment of patients with familial or idiopathic erythrocytosis is mainly focused on preventing hyperviscosity, which strains the heart muscle and may contribute to the development of dangerous complications. Phlebotomy is prescribed to patients with expressed symptoms and signs of hyperviscosity. Phlebotomy is also more often administered to patients who have suffered thromboembolic events. Contrary to PV, the target haematocrit is not clear in other types of erythrocytosis. The need for phlebotomy among patients with <italic class="em">JAK2</italic>-negative erythrocytosis varies due to different aetiology of the disease. In haemoglobinopathies with increased oxygen affinity and compensatory erythrocytosis frequent phlebotomy may even be harmful&#160;<span class="xref">(9,12)</span>. The same phlebotomy regime could be completely appropriate in a different case of <italic class="em">JAK2</italic>-negative erythrocytosis&#160;<span class="xref">(9)</span>.</p>
			<h2><span>5.3 </span>Treating patients with secondary acquired erythrocytosis</h2>
			<p>In addition to treating their symptoms, treatment of patients with secondary acquired erythrocytosis should focus on managing the underlying disease and preventing harmful habits.</p>
			<h1><span>6 </span>Current overview of erythrocytosis in Slovenia</h1>
			<p>We have reviewed the analyses of <italic class="em">JAK2, </italic>mutations performed over a 5-year period (from April 2011 to September 2016) at Ljubljana and Maribor medical centres, the only two institutions with <italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>testing facilities ( <span class="ref-fig">Figure 3</span>). The study was approved by the National&#160;Medical Ethics Committee (ref. KME 115/08/15). In this period, a total of 3,833 individuals were tested, with 1,049 (27 %) confirmed positive and 2,784 (73 %) confirmed negative for <italic class="em">JAK2 V617F</italic> mutation. Identifying the <italic class="em">JAK2</italic> mutation is the first test performed on a patient with erythrocytosis in the haematology office in case of absence of obvious clinical signs and symptoms of secondary erythrocytosis. Therefore, this figure provides an approximate assessment of absolute erythrocytosis in a certain period. As we sought to establish the share of idiopathic and, among these, familial erythrocytosis, we included 1,054 <italic class="em">JAK2 </italic>negative individuals tested at the Ljubljana Medical Centre, who also tested negative for <italic class="em">CALR, MPL, C-KIT </italic>(mutations typical of myeloproliferative neoplasms)&#160;<span class="xref">(7,21,22)</span>.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In addition to medical history and clinical manifestation, we carefully reviewed the blood tests and looked for information on serum concentration of EPO. We selected 81 subjects who had at least 2 test results repeated over a gap of at least two months with Ht and/or Hb concentration over the reference range (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 2</span>), of whom 34 were female and 47 were male. All 81 patients were invited for an interview and examination to clinically evaluate erythrocytosis. 30 subjects, of whom 16 were female and 14 were male, provided informed consent and complete a questionnaire on family history. Among these, three families were identified who had at least two members with erythrocytosis. They were included in genetic testing for familial erythrocytosis&#160;<span class="xref">(23)</span>. We analysed <italic class="em">EPOR, VHL, EPAS1, EPO</italic> and <italic class="em">HBB, </italic>genes with Sange sequencing method as part of student research project, but<italic class="em"> </italic>found no known mutations associated with familial erythrocytosis&#160;<span class="xref">(24-29)</span>. While several new mutations in the <italic class="em">EPO</italic>,<italic class="em"> EPAS1 </italic>and <italic class="em">HBB</italic> genes were identified, additional analysis is needed to identify their clinical significance. Analysis of <italic class="em">EGLN1, HBA </italic>in<italic class="em"> BPGM </italic>genes is ongoing. We are also planning to analyse more gene with next generation sequencing (NGS).</p>
			<h1><span>7 </span>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>This article wishes to draw attention to an area of internal medicine that has not been fully clarified with currently available diagnostic test in Slovenia. We hope that a rather large number of patients with erythrocytosis followed by haematological offices and elsewhere will benefit from our research. We have high hopes in the NGS method, as it enables concurrent diagnostics of all known forms of familial erythrocytosis in a single test.</p>
