			<h1><span>1 </span>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Amblyopia is a reduction of vision in one or both eyes due to a failure of normal neural development in the immature visual system&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. It is the most common cause of monocular visual impairment in both children and young to middle-aged adults, affecting 1 %–5 % of the population&#160;<span class="xref">(2-4)</span>. Amblyopia can lead to permanent loss of vision with the impact on the quality of life. But with vision screening and early detection, amblyopia can be treatable&#160;<span class="xref">(1,3,5)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>2 </span>Etiology</h1>
			<p>Normal visual development is based on clear and equal images transmitted from the eyes to the central nervous system&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. The brain`s visual centres (striate cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus) and neuronal connections develop until 8 years of age or older&#160;<span class="xref">(1,6-8)</span>. Significant disruption of the visual image can result in permanently decreased vision&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. Studies show that also other important aspects of vision, including global processing, colour, motion, and contour perception, are abnormal in amblyopia&#160;<span class="xref">(7,9)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>3 </span>Classification</h1>
			<p>Amblyopia occurs due to two basic conditions – abnormal binocular interaction (e.g., strabismus) and blurring or distortion of primarily central visual image due to uncorrected refractive errors or media opacities&#160;<span class="xref">(1,6,10)</span>. Strabismic and refractive aetiologies account for 90 % of all amblyopia cases&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>.</p>
			<p>Strabismic amblyopia is the most common type of amblyopia, occuring in up to 50 % of cases&#160;<span class="xref">(2,3,6)</span>. Constant, non-alternating or unequally alternating tropias (typically esodeviations) are likely to cause amblyopia. Non-fusible inputs from the two eyes in strabismic amblyopia are thought to lead to domination of cortical vision centres by the fixating eye and reduced responsiveness to input by nonfixating eye&#160;<span class="xref">(6,11,12)</span>.</p>
			<p>Refractive amblyopia can be divided into anisometropic and high bilateral refractive errors. Isoametropic amblyopia occurs usually in children with hyperopia &gt; 3.50 diopters&#160;<span class="xref">(1,13,14)</span>, with myopia &gt; 3.00 dipoters and anisometropia &gt; 1.5 diopters&#160;<span class="xref">(1,14-16)</span>. Amblyogenic factor is also astigmatism &gt; 1.5 diopters at 90 ° or 180 °, or &gt; 1.0 diopters in oblique axis&#160;<span class="xref">(</span><span class="xref">1,14,16)</span>.</p>
			<p>Visual deprivation amblyopia is caused by complete or partial obstruction of the ocular media. Amblyogenic factor is any media opacity &gt; 1 mm in size or ptosis ≤ 1 mm margin reflex distance&#160;<span class="xref">(1,11,14)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>4 </span>Clinical characteristics and diagnosis</h1>
			<p>The accepted definition of clinically significant amblyopia is best-corrected visual acuity ≤ 20/40 or a difference of 2 lines of Snellen acuity between the amblyopic eye and the normal eye. Although best-corrected visual acuities in amblyopic eyes range from mild deficits (20/25) to severe vision loss (≤ 20/400)&#160;<span class="xref">(1,11)</span>. The most severe amblyopia can be found in cases of untreated deprivation during the first few months of life&#160;<span class="xref">(1,3,6)</span>.</p>
			<p>A more accurate assessment of monocular visual acuity is obtained with the presentation of a line of optotypes, as single optotype or picture tests may overestimate visual acuity&#160;<span class="xref">(1,2,11,17)</span>. In less mature children, the visual acuity can be tested with single optotypes with the use of »crowding bars« to surround the optotype for better detection of amblyopic vision loss, symbols and preferential looking techniques. Observation of unequal or poor fixation behaviour with or without a manifest strabismus can also be an evidence of amblyopia&#160;<span class="xref">(1,2,6)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>5 </span>Treatment</h1>
			<p>Amblyopia treatment can be highly successful with ~75 % of children, less than 7 years of age achieving resolution of the amblyopia&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>. The principle of treating amblyopia involves clearing any image blur and encouraging use of the amblyopic eye through preventing use of the better-seeing eye&#160;<span class="xref">(</span><span class="xref">1)</span>. In the setting of residual visual disparity following the maximum improvement in visual acuity with spectacles, the treatment options for the remaining amblyopia include patching or atropine penalization of the fellow eye&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>. Children with a visually significant anatomic abnormality must be approached on an individual basis.</p>
			<p>Occlusion therapy has long been the accepted standard for treatment of unilateral amblyopia, but the details of how long to patch were often debated. Paediatric Eye Disease Investigative Group (PEDIG) amblyopia studies tested part-time versus full- time occlusion (6 hours per day versus all day) for severe strabismic, anisometropic/refractive, or combined mechanism amblyopia (20/100 to 20/400) in children 3 to 7 years of age. There was no difference in response to treatment between the 2 groups&#160;<span class="xref">(1,8,18)</span>.</p>
			<p>PEDIG researchers also evaluated 2 hours versus 6 hours per day patching regimen for moderate amblyopia (20/40 to 20/80) in children between 3 and 7 years of age with anisometropic/refractive, strabismus, or combined-mechanism amblyopia. No difference in efficacy was observed&#160;<span class="xref">(1,19)</span>. But several authors have questioned the results of this study because compliance was monitored by self-reporting&#160;<span class="xref">(8,20,21)</span>.</p>
			<p>PEDIG study also compared the efficacy of daily atropine penalization (1 drop of 1 % atropine sulfate) to patching (6 hours per day) in children 3 to 7 years of age with strabismic and/or anisometropic amblyopia. After 6 months, 2 years and 10 years no significant difference was found&#160;<span class="xref">(1,8,22)</span>.</p>
			<p>Another PEDIG study evaluated daily versus weekend atropine for moderate amblyopia from 20/40 to 20/80. After 4 months, no difference in visual improvement was found between the 2 groups&#160;<span class="xref">(1,8,23)</span>.</p>
			<p>In children less than 8 years of age, who were treated successfully with atropine or patching, 24 % of children had recurrence of amblyopia within 1 year of treatment cessation&#160;<span class="xref">(24)</span>. The recurrence after cessation of treatment can be over 60 %&#160;<span class="xref">(8,25)</span>. For patients treated with 6 or more hours of daily patching, data suggest that the risk of recurrence is greater when patching is stopped abruptly&#160;<span class="xref">(24)</span>. It is suggested that long term monitoring of visual acuity following cessation of treatment is needed in all children to detect and treat potential recurrence&#160;<span class="xref">(</span><span class="xref">8,24)</span>.</p>
			<p>Studies show that even older patients where residual plasticity is present can show improvement in visual acuity in the amblyopic eye&#160;<span class="xref">(26-28)</span>. Treatment should be attempted also in older children, especially in those without previous treatment because up to 47 % of these patients had improvement in visual acuity&#160;<span class="xref">(27)</span>.</p>
			<p>Despite all the evidence concerning the efficacy of treatment, non-compliance remains a major obstacle to successful treatment. Although both atropine and patching treatments were well tolerated by the child and family, atropine was more favourable&#160;<span class="xref">(1,29)</span>.</p>
			<p>A wide range of other treatments for amblyopia has become available, where the patient is also actively involved, e.g. near activities like completing word puzzles, dot- to-dot drawings or colouring-in parts of patterns and pleoptic exercises that were devised with the aim of encouraging the use of the fovea in amblyopes&#160;<span class="xref">(6,30,31)</span>. Medical treatments, which stimulate availability of a variety of neurotransmitters and modulators, including dopamine, have also been used&#160;<span class="xref">(3,32,33)</span>.</p>
			<p>Finally, it is important to prevent vision loss in the sound eye through appropriate monitoring for reverse amblyopia and the prescription of protective glasses for protection from trauma&#160;<span class="xref">(1</span><span class="xref">)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>6 </span>Screening</h1>
			<p>Vision screening is strongly recommended over the course of childhood to detect amblyopia early enough to allow successful treatment&#160;<span class="xref">(1,6,34)</span>. The prevalence of amblyopia is approximately 3 %, but with the detection and treatment of amblyogenic condition by five years of age, the prevalence of clinically significant amblyopia is reduced to around 2 %, and with detection and treatment before three years of age, the prevalence is reduced vto around 1 %&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>.</p>
			<p>A positive family history for amblyopia or strabismus combined with a high hypermetropia indicates a possible risk for amblyopia&#160;<span class="xref">(6,16)</span> as well as prematurity and neuro-developmental delay where prevalence of amblyopia is four to six times higher than in healthy, full-term infants&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>.</p>
			<p>Early in the childhood paediatricians check newborns for optical media clarity. Parents are often the first to raise concerns about abnormalities such as difficulty seeing, an eye that drifts or a head tilt. Irritability in a child while the good eye is covered suggests amblyopia, because the child receives no visual input from the weak eye and therefore cannot see&#160;<span class="xref">(6,35)</span>.</p>
			<p>If no abnormalities were revealed earlier, a systematic check-up at three years of age is very important when visual acuity is assessed&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>. For younger children we can use preferential looking technique&#160;<span class="xref">(36)</span>, since children prefer to watch a certain pattern over a homogenous stimulus. Visual acuity at the age of three years is determined mainly in a playful manner with the help of devices based on the Snellen principle, such as matching letters showed to the child at certain distances with those in the child`s hands. “E” test or any other test, based on the orientation of the optotype, are usually difficult to perform for children aged three years, because they have more difficulty determining the direction than differentiation of details&#160;<span class="xref">(2,6)</span>. For slightly older children visual acuity is assessed at 5 meters with Snellen optotypes. When determining visual acuity, care must be taken that each eye is correctly and completely covered so that child cannot peek with the non-tested eye. Eyeball motility is also tested, and cover test is performed&#160;<span class="xref">(6,35)</span>.</p>
			<p>If the paediatrician detects poor visual acuity on a systematic check-up, the role of an ophthalmologist is to perform the refraction, fundus examination, determine the fixation and carry out further necessary investigations&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>7 </span>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Amblyopia can lead to permanent loss of vision. Therefore, vision screening is very important to detect amblyopia early enough to allow a successful treatment based on clearing image blur and encouraging the use of the amblyopic eye.</p>
