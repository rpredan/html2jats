            <title>Abstract</title>
            <p>Background: Goal-setting is a key element in the rehabilitation process of stroke patients. Patient centeredness has not only become an important underlying principle for the delivery of health and rehabilitation services, it has also become an important aspect of the goal-setting process. Current research in the area of stroke rehabilitation suggests that there is a lack of consensus concerning best practice for goal-setting. The aim of the study was to determine how rehabilitation team members set rehabilitation goals in patients after stroke, which assessment tools do they use and what obstacles are present during the goal-setting process.</p>
            <p>Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 stroke unit rehabilitation team members at the University Rehabilitation Institute. The interview included questions about clinical experience of goal-setting process generally in rehabilitation, the use of assessment tools and problems that arise in setting goals.</p>
            <p>Results: Most of the team members already used goal-setting as a measure of the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment and perceived goal-setting as demanding. Most common mentioned barriers to goal-setting were lack of time, and patient characteristics (disease, personality and expectations). Specific improvements were suggested regarding education.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: This study highlights a number of issues relevant to rehabilitation team members during the goal-setting process in stroke rehabilitation. Rehabilitation process should be pati­ent-centred and goal-directed. In the future, it is important to develop clear guidelines about goal-setting in stroke rehabilitation, as well as additional training for healthcare professionals.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>After a stroke patients often exhibit physical, cognitive, social and emotional consequences that result in the stroke having an effect on many aspects of a patient’s life. Consequently a multidisciplinary team approach is recommended for rehabilitation of stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Goal setting has become an integral part of the rehabilitation process of stroke patients, and is also recommended in national clinical guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The set goals must be clear, understandable and represent a challenge for the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Focus should also be on the activity and participation, and both short-term and long-term elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Goals can also help therapists to guide the therapy, to make a discharge plan and handle the expectations of the patient and their relatives regarding the progress, and forecast the functional outcome after the discharge from the rehabilitation institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Goal-setting also improves communication among different members of the rehabilitation team and their cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p>
         <p>Setting rehabilitation goals is a demanding process, consisting of different concepts. Both short-term and long-term expectations of the patient, their relatives and the healthcare professionals have to be taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The healthcare professionals are often uncertain of what level of rehabilitation can be achieved and how to include the patients who do not yet know what they want, or may have unrealistic expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). A discord in the goals set by rehabilitation team members and the patient is one of the key factors that worsen the outcome of a rehabilitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Scobbie et al. describe that therapists are often expected to set and achieve therapeutic goals, even though they often lack clear instructions to guide them in how to use their theoretical knowledge when setting the goals in day-to-day clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The participating therapists describe the fear of losing professional authority and the lack of time and resources as the most frequent obstacles when setting goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In previous research different goal-setting methods were used in the rehabilitation process for stroke patients, however, no methods have yet been developed specifically for treating stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p>
         <p>Only a few studies have been made that included aspects of different therapeutic groups of the rehabilitation team regarding goal-setting for patients who suffered a stroke; in most cases the study sample only included one therapeutic group (e.g. doctors, occupational therapists, physiotherapists). The studies were also fairly heterogeneous, and consequently it was difficult to set clear conclusions regarding the effectiveness and the adoption of goal-setting in rehabilitation teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In most studies the therapists agreed that goal-setting is a key process of the rehabilitation treatment, even though it is frequently limited by practical obstacles. They also believed that the goals should be patient-oriented, specific, ambitious and time-limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Even though many motivational factors for including patients in the process of setting rehabilitation goals are present, there are also numerous obstacles (e.g. lack of time, uncooperative patients, communication issues, organizational difficulties) that decrease the frequency of using goals in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Goal setting is mainly guided by therapists, while patients and their relatives are not included in this process as much. Goals are especially focused on an activity and not on participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Literature rarely describes the role of nurses in rehabilitation goal-setting, making it more difficult for them to prove the effectiveness of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The only study that reviewed the opinions of different rehabilitation team members regarding the goal-setting aspect in stroke patients therapy included occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech therapists, and was conducted on a relatively small sample of 13 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). There is a need for further research regarding goal-setting in regular clinical practice of rehabilitation treatment of stroke patients.</p>
         <p>The objective of our study was to establish how rehabilitation team members set rehabilitation goals for stroke patients, which assessment tools they use, what obstacles are present in goal-setting, and what are the options for improving the knowledge in goal-setting.</p>

         <title>The subjects and the methods</title>
         <p>The study included all the members (35 people) of the rehabilitation team at the Department for rehabilitation of patients after stroke of the University Rehabilitation Institute of the Republic of Slovenia. All participants filled out the questionnaire. We assembled a questionnaire that included 13 close-ended questions in which the participants selected 1 answer from 4 according to the Likert scale, 1 close-ended question where they selected 1 answer from 3 according to Likert scale, 3 close-ended questions in which the participants selected 1 answer from 2 according to the Likert scale, 3 close-ended questions with more possible answers, 1 combined close-ended and open-ended question, and 3 open-ended questions. With close-ended questions the participants selected among 2 and up to 6 possible answers, namely: about how demanding is setting rehabilitation goals, the estimate of the time that takes to reach a therapy goal, patient inclusion in goal-setting process, differentiating between the patient’s and the therapists’ set goals, using assessment tools for estimating the achievement of the therapy goal, how often is it reasonable to inform the patient on the progress in achieving the goals, the factors that can hinder goal achievement, the principles and used methods for goal-setting, the characteristics of the higher quality set goals, the issues and negative aspects of goal-setting, the impact of goal-setting on the organization of work in rehabilitation treatment and the possibilities for improving the obtained knowledge in setting goals. The data from the filled out questionnaires were entered into Excel. We performed descriptive statistics for the basic parameters and prepared visual representations of some results. The statistical analysis displays the data for numerical variables as percentages or median (range).</p>

            <p>The sample of 35 members of the rehabilitation team included: 6 doctors, 3 registered nurses, 9 medical technicians, 2 psychologists, 2 speech therapists, 2 social workers, 6 physiotherapists and 5 occupational therapists; 32 were women and 3 were men. The median age was 37.0 years (range of 24.0–67.0 years), the median work experience was 11.3 years (range of 0.8–43.1 years) and the median work experience in a team for rehabilitation of stroke patients was 7.0 years (range of 0.08–38.0 years). Once all the participants were divided into subgroups by total years of work experience, the 0–5 years group included 9 people, the 5.1–10 years group included 5 people and the &gt;10 year group included 21 people. When taking into account years of work experience in a team for rehabilitation of stroke patients, the 0–5 years group included 15 people, the 5.1–10 years group included 8 people and the &gt;10 year group included 12 people.</p>

            <p>In the study 88.2 % of the rehabilitation team members responded that they use goal achievement as a measure of effectiveness of the rehabilitation process, while 11.8 % are not using it yet. At the same time most rehabilitation team members found that goal-setting significantly (62.9 %) or at least somewhat (34.3 %) improves the organization of team work, while only 2.8 % of respondents believed it has little effect.</p>
            <p>Most respondents believe that setting rehabilitation goals is a demanding process (74.3 %), while 25.7 % found that this is not a demanding process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At the same time 54.3 % of respondents also said that deciding on when a rehabilitation goal is achieved is moderately demanding, while fewer were of the opinion that it is very (11.4 %) or somewhat (8.6 %) demanding, or not demanding at all (26.7 %). 54.3 % find that the goals set by therapists upon admittance rarely change until the patients are discharged, while 40.0 % find that goals change frequently during this time, and 5.7 % find that they always change. Quite the opposite, the goals set by the patient at admittance and at discharge from care differed in most cases (79.4 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A good half of respondents (54.3 %) said that it is possible to estimate already during admittance in what time a patient will be able to achieve a certain rehabilitation goal, while 45.7 % found that it is not possible to estimate the time frame for achieving rehabilitation goals upon admittance. More than a half of the respondents said that when admitting a patient long-term goals can be only seldomly set (57.1 %), while 5.7 % believed that this is not possible at all; on the other hand, 37.2 % believed that long-term goals can also be frequently set upon admittance.</p>

            <p>Most (63.6 %) rehabilitation team members did not establish any negative aspects of setting rehabilitation goals, while 36.4 % found negative aspects, with one rehabilitation team member describing the following: the stress for a patient not achieving the set therapy goals, the goals that are not specific enough, or those that are defined too narrowly and possibly exclude other important goals, as well as any complications arising from a change to the rehabilitation treatment due to adaptation to a new method of work, different competence levels of medical professionals, a patient’s lack of interest in achieving goals, too much focus on filling out forms than on patient’s contact, what to do when a plateau is reached in a set goal; 2 team members said: unrealistic expectations of patients and their relatives, a disconnect between the need for good communication and the lack of time for patient treatment, inconsistency in using assessment tools for goal achievement; 3 team members said: discrepancy between the goals of the rehabilitation team members and those of the patient.</p>
            <p>According to rehabilitation team members the patient is mostly included in the process of setting rehabilitation goals (frequently in 60.0 % of the cases, always in 28.6 % and never in 11.4 %). According to a half of the respondents the goals set by a therapist often differ from the goals set by the patient (54.3 %), while 5.7 % said that this happens always, and 40.0 % that this happens rarely. Setting goals for patients with aphasia reached a similar percentage (always with 11.4 %, frequently with 37.1 %) and was not a major issue for rehabilitation team members (rarely with 48.6 % and never with 2.9 %).</p>

            <p>Most respondents (94.3 %) found that the most important characteristic of a set rehabilitation goal is patient-centredness, and that it must be set in collaboration between the therapist and the patient. The respondents found that setting goals allows the patient to understand that rehabilitation is a gradually improving process (80.0 %), that goal-setting must include the purpose and the available time (74.3 %), that the goals must include the patient’s perspective (68.6 %), that goals are important for motivation, patient interaction and for better patient cooperation (65.7 %), that the goals focus the therapist to be more specific in fulfilling the set task (62.9 %), while a minority found that setting goals increases the patient’s trust in the therapist’s work (34.3 %). More than a half (54.3 %) of rehabilitation team members were aware of setting goals according to the SMART system (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), while 45.7 % respondents did not know this principle. The concept of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) was according to the participants’ opinion included frequently or always in only 33.3 % of goal-setting procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

            <p>The recommendations for improving the knowledge in goal-setting from rehabilitation team members include: the need for further education in goal-setting and assessment tools, education on the biopsychosocial approach to therapy, education on stroke and prognostic factors, using appropriate strategy for setting measurable goals (e.g. SMART), improvement of information flow and good collaboration among rehabilitation team members, knowledge transfer between individual members of the therapy team, constant monitoring of goal achievement by all rehabilitation team members, promptly informing the patient and their relatives about the level of achieved goals, the supervision of the whole team and for more time for treating individual patients. Medical technicians also added to this question that they would prefer more emphasis on setting and adhering to the nursing goals. Some therapists also said that they are not aware of any education courses for improving their knowledge in goal-setting. A great majority of the respondents believe that they would need additional education in goal-setting (79.4 %), with only 20.6 % believing they do not need this.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Most respondents in our study estimated that they use goal achievement as a measure of the success rate of the rehabilitation therapy. This matches with the data from other studies that reported goal-setting is used for most patients, that activities related to goal-setting are routinely documented with 83 % of patients, and that team meetings related to goal-setting are most frequently held on a weekly basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The study from Young at al. also notes that rehabilitation team members assessed that goal-setting is useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Goal setting also improves multidisciplinary team work and helps in assessing the result of the rehabilitation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Studies show that all rehabilitation team members are responsible for planning rehabilitation therapy of stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In spite of the fact that all medical technicians in our study found that setting rehabilitation goals is a demanding process, in most cases they confirmed using goal-setting as a measure for rehabilitation therapy. Medical technicians at the department do not directly set rehabilitation goals, but they always set them together with registered nurses, and assist in goal achievement. According to literature medical technicians play an important role in goal-setting, as they have the most direct contact with the patient, and can also discuss any potential obstacles with them, as well as monitor the patient’s progress and report on it to other team members(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p>
         <p>We did not find any data in the literature on the rate that the therapists’ or patient’s goals are changed until the patient’s discharge. According to our research, therapists most often do not change the set goals, while the patients’ goals are often changed until they are discharged. The goals set by the patients are often broader and also include their long-term wishes and ideas regarding regaining physical activity and independence and the return of previous activity level and the role, while the medical professionals usually set more short-term and specific goals, focused on the patient’s functional defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). According to literature, the goals are more reliably forecast with patients suffering from a mild to moderate defect, as they are kept in a hospital environment for period of time before being discharged into home care, and will be able to independently care for themselves at discharge. This group of patients could also be presented with a list of pre-set goals that they could choose from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). During rehabilitation therapy most patients are in the acute or subacute period after the stroke, when recovery can be relatively fast, so the short-term steps in goal-setting are more suitable, as they include the functional defect and the basic daily activities, gradually leading up to long-term goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Rehabilitation team members included in our study also noted in more than half of the cases that it is rarely possible to plan long-term goals when admitting a patient. Setting goals can also have negative aspects due to the conflict resulting from the differences between the goals set by the therapist and those set by the patient, in relation to competitiveness between patients and with aggressive assessments of goal achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p>
         <p>Similarly to our study, several foreign ones also showed that the goals set by the therapist often differ from the patient’s goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). That is why it is recommended for the patient to actively collaborate in planning and setting the rehabilitation goals. Such patient inclusion in goal-setting increases the patient’s motivation and satisfaction, makes better use of the available time, allows for comprehensive planning and gives the patient the sense of control over their own rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). According to our study, the patient is mostly included in the process of setting rehabilitation goals, while according to literature, this is only the case in 13–60 % of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). According to literature, about a half of therapists give the planned goals to the patient in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p>
         <p>Most respondents in our study estimated that using assessment tools is important for assessing the success rate of achieving the rehabilitation goals, as they allow for comparison between different patients and medical services. Literature does not yet provide any guidelines with clear and uniform instructions for setting rehabilitation goals for stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In most cases informal types are still used (e.g. informal interview), however, with such an approach the goals are often unclear and not substantiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Formal types of goal-setting are used more rarely (most often the Goal Achievement Scale (GAS) and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), planning goals according to the SMART principle, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). GAS and COPM are established grades that provide a standardised approach to establishing patient-oriented goals and measuring the progress of achieving the set goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Of these recommended tools the occupational therapists in our study listed regularly using COPM, while other assessment tools are not yet in regular clinical use. However, different scales for assessing functioning stroke patients are used. According to literature formal methods for setting rehabilitation goals are used by only 14 % of therapists, with fewer than 5 % using patient questionnaires for assessing their priorities in goal-setting (e.g. Rivermead Life Goals Questionnaire) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Even though more than a half of the respondents answered that they knew goal planning according to the SMART principle, it is not yet used in regular clinical practice, even though according to literature it provides better goal planning, bringing benefits both to the patient and the therapist, as it is not time consuming or difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). This way every goal is set based on the target activity, the need for support, assessment of performance and the time required for achieving a certain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Thus far a few studies have been made that have used the ICF concept when assessing the results of the sets goals, and the meta-analysis showed a significant impact on improvement of the health-related quality of living and the emotional state when using such a method of goal-setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). According to our survey, the ICF concept is only rarely included in goal-setting, as it is regularly used by doctors, and only rarely by other team members.</p>
         <p>In foreign literature rehabilitation team members listed numerous factors that have a negative effect on the process of setting rehabilitation goals. Among external factors the most often mentioned include limited number of medical professionals, other tasks on admittance day, organizational pressures, lack of clinical experience, poor information exchange among rehabilitation team members, lack of time and short hospitalization time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Often there is a conflict between the speed that the patients want to improve and the actual course of therapy and the difficulty in transferring the goals from the hospital environment into the patient’s home environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Additional negative factors listed are similar to those from our study: poor cooperation of the patient, communication issues between the patient, their relatives and rehabilitation team members, cognitive decline, tiredness, mood disorders, lack of insight and denial of the condition, unrealistic expectations of the patient and their relatives, a patient’s passive personality, accompanying diseases and health swings, all of which are obstacles in a patient’s cooperation in rehabilitation programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). An additional obstacle described was that the patient and their relatives have a poor understanding of the rehabilitation therapy and the medical condition, and consequently also a poor understanding of their issues, the rehabilitation process and the potential for recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Patients with speech and language disorders or with a cognitive decline can still be helped through goal planning, even though it is often difficult to explain them clearly to the patient. It is recommended to use customized materials for patients with aphasia, such as communication aids, pictures and to utilize the help of a speech therapist when setting the goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p>
         <p>The need for additional education in setting rehabilitation goals was emphasized by the majority of respondents. Studies recommend additional education with the objective of training those team members with lower confidence and knowledge for setting patient-oriented goals and for improving the listening, negotiating and communication skills of medical professionals, as well as for improving knowledge about the recovery after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Patients also need to be educated about their changed role from passive observers into active participants when setting goals, as well as how to communicate with the medical professionals about their own needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p>
         <p>The study sample was small, as it only included team members of stroke patient rehabilitation. In order to increase the sample it would also need to include members of other rehabilitation teams who treat other diseases, which could in turn make the data more heterogeneous. After dividing into individual therapy groups, individual groups only counted 2 to 9 members, and therefore using statistical tests to compare results among individual therapy groups was not possible.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Setting rehabilitation goals is a complex and demanding process. In spite of that rehabilitation team members are aware of the importance of setting and pursuing goals during rehabilitation therapy. In most cases the patient is already included in the process of setting rehabilitation goals. They are also aware of potential issues in goal-setting that may arise from work organisation and the patient’s characteristics. In the future more randomised control studies will be needed to assess the positive effects of using rehabilitation goals in rehabilitation therapy, as current studies are very heterogeneous and do not provide clear conclusions. Clear guidelines and assessment tools are also needed, along with additional education of the patients and the medical professionals.</p>
