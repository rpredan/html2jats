			<h1><span>1 </span>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is an acute disease of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. Unlike in adults, where it accounts for only 5–10 % of cases, AAC is the most common form of acute cholecystitis in children (50–70 % of cases)&#160;<span class="xref">(1,2)</span>. Although it is mostly described in literature as a complication of severe trauma or burns, severe systemic disease (Mb. Kawasaki, systemic lupus eritematosus, nephrotic syndrome), complete parenteral nutrition or severe dehydration, it is most often the effect, in immunocompetent paediatric population, of infection with diffetent organisms&#160;<span class="xref">(1,3,4)</span>. AAC development both in adults and children has been noted following infection with bacteria (<italic class="em">Brucella </italic>spp., <italic class="em">Campylobacter jejuni, Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira </italic>spp, <italic class="em">Mycobacterium </italic>spp., <italic class="em">Salmonella </italic>spp and <italic class="em">Vibrio cholerae</italic>), fungi (<italic class="em">Candida </italic>spp), viruses (hepatitis A and B viruses – HAV, HBV, Epstein-Barr virus – EBV, cytomegalovirus – CMV and flavivirus) and parasites (<italic class="em">Plasmodium </italic>spp, <italic class="em">Ascaris lumbricoides </italic>and <italic class="em">Echinococcus</italic>); of which infections with EBV and HAV are described the most often&#160;<span class="xref">(1,5)</span><span class="xref">.</span> The article presents a case of AAC following primary EBV infection.</p>
			<h1><span>2 </span>Case presentation</h1>
			<p>A seventeen year old male was admitted following 14 days of nausea, fatigue and decreased appetite. On the day of admission, the patient began to complain about epigastric pain, which responded poorly to treatment with pantoprazole and metamizole. The patient had previously been healthy and had not been receiving any medication. Upon admission, the patient looked tired and pale, had no temperature, had mild pharyngitis and no signs of tonsillitis. The abdomen was at the level of the chest and very sensitive in the area of xiphoid process and upper right quadrant, while the liver and spleen were not enlarged to touch. Upon auscultation, bowel sounds were observed in all four quadrants. Otherwise, physical status was normal. Laboratory reports showed mild leucocytosis (13.70 × 10<sup class="sup">9</sup>/L; in differential blood count were 78 % lymphocytes, 4 % monocytes, 3 % banded neutrophils, 15 % segmented neutrophils) and mildly elevated values of C-reactive protein 5.1 mg/L (reference range (RR) 0–3.5 mg/L). Electrolyte and blood urea nitrogen values were within normal range. The patient was first treated for acute inflammation of the stomach lining. Parenteral therapy with H2 receptor antagonist and analgesics was introduced, and the patient was put on gastric diet. The second day of hospitalisation the pain began to escalate, and the patient began to vomit. Clinically, enlarged and hyperemic tonsils with gray-white pathes, and an enlarged spleen were noted. Follow-up laboratory reports showed elevated values of total bilirubin 63 µmol/L (RV:3–17 µmol/L), and direct bilirubin 42 µmol/L (RR: 0–3 µmol/L), aspartate aminotransferase 9.23 µkat/L (RR: 0.01–0.58 µkat/L), alanine aminotransferase 16.48 µkat/L (RR: 0.01–0.74), gamma glutamyl transferase 5.00 µkat/L (RR 0.03–0.70 µkat/L), amylase 3.53 µkat/L (RR: 0.01–1.92 µkat/L) and lipase 21.73 µkat/L (RR: 1.21–6.55 µkat/L).</p>
			<p>Extensive microbiological testing was performed to investigate pathological values of liver enzymes. Rapid agglutination test based on Paul Brunnel reaction detected the presence of IgM heterophile antibodies to EBV (PB-HA), which indicate possible acute infection with EBV. CMV antibody titres were also elevated, which was established using Chemiluminescence Assay (CLIA), with IgM: 33.2 U/ml, IgG: 129.00 U/ml. Rapid strep test from a pharynx swab was negative. Possible infection with HAV and HCV was excluded. When testing for hepatitis B viral infection (HBV), HBV surface antigen (HBs Ag) was negative, while IgG antibodies to HBV surface antigen (anti HBs) were positive, which is consistent with an immune response following vaccination. Haemocultures were sterile. Helicobacter pylori antigen using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was detected in a stool sample.</p>
			<p>Ultrasound (US) of the abdomen was performed, which showed contracted gallbladder with thickened and stratified wall (1–1.5 cm), in addition to a small amount of free fluid by the liver. Although the sonography of the gallbladder was not entirely clear, there were no signs of hardened deposits as well as no dilatiation of the ducts. The spleen was enlarged and palpable, with a diameter of up to 16 cm, with lymph nodes in the upper part of the abdomen enlarged too. The original therapy was continued and an antiemetic agent added (setronone). The US was repeated the fourth day of hospitalisation, when the diagnosis of AAC was confirmed. After consulting surgeons, conservative treatment was continued and antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid introduced. The patient’s general condition improved, the pain and tonsillitis subsided, and laboratory testing noted a decrease in the values of liver enzymes. The tenth day of hospitalisationthe patient was prescribed oral antibiotic and discharged into home care. US before release revealed a normal gallbladder without visible pathological changes. Three months after the end of hospitalisation the patient had appropriate physical ability, and biochemical values of liver enzymes were within the normal range.</p>
			<p>Due to positive HP antigen in the stool, triple therapy with clindamycin, amoxicillin and proton pump inhibitor was introduced following the end of treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. The follow-up stool sample, tested for HP antigen 8 weeks after eradication treatment was negative.</p>
			<h1><span>3 </span>Discussion</h1>
			<p>AAC is a rare complication of primary EBV infection. Since 2000, 23 cases have been described among pediatric population&#160;<span class="xref">(6-26)</span>, most of them in Europe, of which seven were described in Greece&#160;<span class="xref">(7,8,11-13,20)</span>. This article is the first presentation of AAC linked to EBV based on a clinical case in Slovene medical literature.</p>
			<p>AAC has diverse and non-specific clinical presentation. Most common clinical symptoms in children are fever and abdominal pain&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. Like in most other described cases, the reason that prompted a visit to the physician was abdominal pain. Upon admission, while the patient had mild pharyngitis, he lacked typical clinical presentation of infectious mononucleosis (IM) with generalised lymphadenopathy and fever&#160;<span class="xref">(12)</span>. Only splenomegaly and tonsillitis with patches that manifested on the second day of hospitalisation led us to suspect infection with EBV infection. The patient also reported early signs of IM, including nausea, fatigue and decreased appetite, which had appeared 14 days prior abdominal pain.</p>
			<p>Although US criteria for diagnosing AAC remain inconclusive, the following descriptions are most often reported in literature: absence of gallstones, stratified thickened wall (&gt; 3.5–4 mm), expanded gallbladder, pericholecistic fluid, localised sensitivity (sonographic Murphy sign) and the presence of sludge in the gallbladder. In addition to characteristic clinical presentation, at least two signs should be observed; our patient had four of them&#160;<span class="xref">(1,27,28)</span>.</p>
			<p>Although the pathogenesis of AAC following EBV infection is not fully known, two mechanisms are suggested: systemic inflammation activity and/or cholestasis&#160;<span class="xref">(25,27,29,30)</span>. The crucial role of systemic inflammation is inferred in the analysis of clinical cases of AAC published by 2016 by Kottanattu et al.&#160;<span class="xref">(31)</span>, where cholestatic pattern in laboratory testing was reported only in one out of 37 patients&#160;<span class="xref">(25)</span>. Systemic inflammation mechanism can also explain other complications of IM, such as acute pancreatitis&#160;<span class="xref">(31)</span>.</p>
			<p>However, substances in the bile, such as β-glucuronidase and lysophosphatidylcholine, can directly cause damage to gallbladder mucosa, release of proinflammatory cytokines and development of cholecystitis&#160;<span class="xref">(5,27,32-34)</span>. Additionally, lymphadenitis with extrinsic obstruction of the cystic duct, direct damage of hepatocytes caused by EBV-infected cytotoxic lymphocytes and genetic polymorphism of the enzymes assisting in the synthesis and transport of bile acids are thought to contribute to the development of liver cholestasis&#160;<span class="xref">(1,5,34-36)</span>. This would explain a more difficult course of infection in patients with Gilbert syndrome with homozygous or heterozygous mutation UGTA1*28, which was described by Attilakos et al&#160;<span class="xref">(11)</span>. We did not pursue genetic testing of our patient. Oestrogen is also considered to play a significant role in the development of AAC by promoting the production of proinflammatory mediators, which would explain the fact that most reported cases are women&#160;<span class="xref">(12,34,37)</span>.</p>
			<p>With a single exception where cholecystectomy was performed, AAC was treated conservatively with parenteral rehydration, analgesic therapy and nutrition support&#160;<span class="xref">(7,10,26)</span>. In most cases, after diagnosing AAC, treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic or a combination of antibiotics, such as amoxicillin with clavulanic acid or a combination of ceftazidime, gentamicine and metronidazole was initiated&#160;<span class="xref">(7,10,26)</span>. However, after reviewing both paediatric and adult cases, Agergaard et al&#160;<span class="xref">(38)</span> established that disease did not progress more unfavourably even when no antibiotic was introduced. Therefore, with AAC diagnosis following EBV the individual decision on whether to introduce antibiotic or not is left to the physician.</p>
			<p>Our patient had elevated anti-CMV IgM and anti-CMV IgG antibodies determined with CLIA method, which could point to concurrent subacute infection with CMV virus. According to available literature, clinical presentation of IM in case of concurrent infection with EBV and CMV is atypical, more intensive and complex, particularly in adolescents&#160;<span class="xref">(39)</span>. However, reduced immunity as the result of lower relationship between CD4/CD with EBV infection could lead to reactivation of a latent CMV infection&#160;<span class="xref">(39-41)</span>. Moreover, Nishikawa et al. established that acute infection with EBV can lead to cross-reactivity with the synthesis of anti-M protein antibodies of other herpes viruses, one of which is CMV&#160;<span class="xref">(42)</span>. As we did not choose to further diagnose potential CMV infection of the patient, we cannot reliably interpret serology results. </p>
			<p>Microbiologic testing of the patient’s stool sample indicated HP-positive antigen. While HP is mentioned in literature as a possible etiological factor for the development of acute and chronic calculous cholecystitis, we failed to establish a link between AAC and HP in available literature&#160;<span class="xref">(43,44,45,46)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>4 </span>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>AAC is the most common form of cholecystitis in paediatric population. In immunocompetent children, the disease is most often of viral etiology, generally caused by EBV&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. In case of suspected IM presented with severe pain, an abdominal ultrasound and testing for liver function biomarkers should be performed. Usually, the disease is treated symptomatically and has a favourable outcome. While opinion on the need to introduce antibiotic therapy remains divided, a broad-spectrum antibiotic was introduced in most cases presented in literature.</p>
