			<h1><span>1 </span>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Usually, the catheter ablation (CA) is performed via a transfemoral approach. In the transfemoral approach, the femoral vein is punctured and the catheters are then advanced into the body and to the heart through the femoral vein and inferior vena cava (IVC). The advancement of the catheters to the heart can be difficult or impossible in patients with congenital IVC anomalies. Other alternative approach for CA in such patients is the transjugular approach. The transjugular approach is done through a puncture of the internal jugular vein. The catheters are then advanced through the puncture into the vein and through the superior vena cava into the heart.</p>
			<p>During CA, fluoroscopy is commonly used for visualization and guidance of the catheters in the heart. New methods have been suggested to avoid harmful effects of the radiation exposure to the patient, as well as to the operator&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. One of the methods is zero-fluoroscopy approach, where no fluoroscopy is used during CA. Visualization and guidance of the catheters is done by the help of the three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic mapping (EAM) system and ICE&#160;<span class="xref">(2)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>2 </span>Case presentation</h1>
			<p>An 18-year-old man with congenital agenesis of IVC and structurally normal heart was admitted to our department for CA due to Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The 12-lead ECG suggested right anterolateral accessory pathway (AP) (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>A).</p>

Potential in the channel ABL 1–2 (distal electrode of the ablation catheter) is recorded 36 ms before the start of the delta wave in the first part of the recording. The second part of the recording shows a QRS complex without pre-excitation and delay between the atrial and ventricular potential in the channel ABL 1–2 as evidence of the loss of AP conduction.</p>

RA – right atrium; RV – right ventricle; abl – ablation catheter; the arrow is pointing to the tip of the ablation catheter positioned at the ventricular aspect of the anterolateral part of the tricuspid annulus.</p>

			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor000"></a>The procedure was performed under conscious sedation. We performed two ultrasound-guided percutaneous punctures of the right internal jugular vein and navigated catheters by the use of 3D EAM system. A 4-polar non-steerable diagnostic catheter was inserted into the coronary sinus and a non-irrigated ablation catheter into the right ventricle. Mapping during sinus rhythm confirmed the earliest ventricular activation at the anterolateral part of the tricuspid annulus (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>B). Radiofrequency ablation of the site with 30 W terminated the ventricular pre-excitation and conduction over the AP within 3 seconds (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>C). During the procedure we used ICE to navigate and ensure the stability of the ablation catheter at the ablation site (<span class="ref-fig">Figure 1</span>D). No fluoroscopy was used at any time during the procedure. The procedure lasted for 135 minutes. There were no procedure-related complications and the patient was discharged from the hospital the next day. Pre-excitation was no longer present on the 12 lead ECG.</p>
			<h1><span>3 </span>Discussion</h1>
			<p>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in children requiring therapy&#160;<span class="xref">(3)</span>. WPW syndrome is the most common type of SVT in adolescent population with a prevalence of 1.5 per 1000&#160;<span class="xref">(4)</span>. This group of patients is at risk of sudden cardiac death, which is estimated at 2 per 1000 patient years&#160;<span class="xref">(</span><span class="xref">5)</span>. The recommended treatment for patients with WPW syndrome is radiofrequency CA&#160;<span class="xref">(6)</span>.</p>
			<p>The patient in our case report had a congenital agenesis of IVC – a rare congenital anomaly of IVC affecting up to 1 % of general population&#160;<span class="xref">(7)</span>. The absence of the IVC precluded the transfemoral approach, and the transjugular approach was chosen as an alternative. Recently, a case series of CA of right-sided AP anterior and anterolateral AP via a transjugular approach in paediatric population with short fluoroscopy times and doses was published. They reported a high acute and long-term success rate, as well as no complications related to the procedure&#160;<span class="xref">(8)</span>.</p>
			<p>Although fluoroscopy can be an effective way to visualize and guide the catheters in the heart, it also exposes the patients and the operator to non-negligible ionizing radiation. Recent epidemiological studies show that even low doses of ionizing radiation can be harmful and no safe-dose limit exists&#160;<span class="xref">(1)</span>. Paediatric patients are at a higher risk of potentially harmful effects of ionizing radiation exposure – estimated at a four times higher than in a 50-year old male patient&#160;<span class="xref">(9)</span>. For the operator, the average exposure is around 5 mSV with a typical cumulative lifetime risk on the order of magnitude of 1 cancer per 100 exposed subjects&#160;<span class="xref">(10)</span>. Recent observational case series observed a disproportionate number of tumours in the left side of the brain – the region known to be more exposed to ionizing radiation&#160;<span class="xref">(11)</span>.</p>
			<h1><span>4 </span>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>To our knowledge this is the first case report to confirm the feasibility of successful ablation of a right-sided anterolateral AP via a transjugular approach without any use of fluoroscopy. A combination of 3D EAM system and ICE can be used to ensure both the correct position and stability of the ablation catheter in the heart. In addition, the fluoroless procedure enables avoidance of potential harmful effects of fluoroscopy exposure for the patient and the operator.</p>
